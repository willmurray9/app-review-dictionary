0,"Had a terrible experience with their fraud department team. Horrible. Beyond that, the process from transferring money from your bank to it reflecting in your invest account is wayy too long. 6 days? Also, I can't for the life of me understand why there isn't a feature to transfer money from your Spend account to your Invest account? As much as I like the clean UI, and simplicity of the app [in regards to navigation], too many little things makes this a horrible experience."
1,Unbelievable. I attempted at least 10 times to start a account and it kept- email not correct so I rechecked my phone and yep it was. so I went through all this nonsense about confirmation numbers. It Finally worked. Then it said my password was not correct. I went through everything and tried over and over. I Uninstalled..Then I tried it out again and couldn't even change it to a new password. This is too much hassle for me. I will just look for a different application that wants me.
2,You just lost a loyal customer!! I try logging into my account and it says it's locked and needs further verification. No one can tell me why my account is locked.. I've sent countless verification forms via email and now they want to 3 way my bank in which I have to give personal info over the phone with them listening in!!?!?!?! Screw that! Put the money bank into the account in which it came from and close me out!! I'm done and beyond pissed!!!!!!
3,No starts if I could Took money from me and now won't respond. Not to mention I didn't complete my account or give it a day to start taking for investing Costumer support absolutely sucks. Will take your money. I usually don't leave bad reviews but this is beyond ridiculous. Taking money I don't even have yet without permission. Bulls***. QUIT TAKING MY MONEY. F***
4,"Very shady customer service. I've talked to numerous people from customer service, all of them telling me different things, and none solving my issue or giving me an answer. The people i referred went through the same issue with customer service and had to talk to several people. Growing increasingly frustrated not only for not getting help, but for being told everything was good then being told something different after the 7/3 promo ended."
5,"Terrible customer service, and God forbid you get there spend account card from them prepare to wait for a month or more . The other issue is if you lose your card and you have to get a replacement expect to wait another 2 months to receive a new one. Do not get Acorn save yourself the headache ."
6,"Do not use this. I've had an account for maybe 5 years. I am low income student and had to switch to not depositing money. So far, it says my net gain is 200. Then I realized they somehow switched to charging me 2 dollars a month, and I don't even have acorns later set up. I go to switch to the lite plan (which is $1/mo) and the page freezes at the end every time, so I can't tell if the request is even submitted. On top of that, I'm not sure what they take when you close the account..."
7,"Well unfortunately this issue has happened more than one time acorns failed to cash my check, I work paycheck to paycheck I need every last dollar to pay my rent, they make you write on the back or ""acorns Mobile deposit only"" and then you sit and wait two to three days for them to send an email saying we hit a snag cash in your check and no information thus far, now that made my check unusable and I had to wait to have another check reissued... No longer trusting acorns with my money!"
8,Had to change my review from 5 stars to one because they will not return email about transfers. The transfer was requested over a month ago and still hasn't happened. I liked acorns but wanted to have a little more control over my investments. I would have recommended them for completely hands off investors until this happened. But to not respond to 4 straight emails is rediculous. And I did receive an email saying that they had received my communication and would respond within 24 hours.
9,"It's an interesting idea but their support is terrible, special offers are denied even if you do everything right on your end, and the UI can be very frustrating to navigate."
10,I have been trying to get the app to verify my bank account so I can start the round up but it always says there is something wrong with the server or when I proceed to verify it says it deposited some small amounts to my account but nothing is there. I uninstalled and installed again and nothing helped. I was really excited about getting this app to start investing but I'm just dissapointed now.
11,"Terrible customer service. Having the same issue with no resolution for over 1 year. Multiple calls, dozens of emails and nothing."
12,I am very pissed. I was curious and went through this app but never said yes or agreed to be charged but it still pulled money from my bank account. Shame on you for doing this. I will be calling and telling my bank to stop payment.
13,"I downloaded this app at least a week ago. I set up my account immediately, but it won't let me set up the invest feature. I've tried and tried since I got it, but all it says is to try again in a few minutes. If I can't use the app for the one reason I downloaded it, what is the point of having it? There isn't one"
14,Dont use this app! I have never had so much trouble withdrawing my own money! I have been trying to access and withdraw funds for over a month and everytime they lock my account!
15,Idk. I'm the short term I don't see the growth. It may display I'm up percentage but if I include they monthly subscription I'm at a loss. Idk I'm going to give it a little more time but.... We'll see
16,"I've canceled my subscription 3 times and I'm still being charged monthly. Any profit you might make from this will get sapped away, not worth time and headache"
17,"Haven't been able to set up my investment account for a week since signing up. Says ""We weren't able to contact the server."" Unacceptable."
18,"I have set up my account almost a month ago and still cannot use it due to bugs. My bank accounts that are linked don't show up on the linked accounts page, and despite finishing my profile and completing the paperwork that I had to submit a request to support to figure out, my account start up is still being processed. On the verge if giving up and deleting it for something more user friendly."
19,"Subpar... It was working for all of one day then it stopped working completely Suspended my account despite the fact that I had cash in my bank. Tried to fix it and it told me to reverify my account, it hasn't sent me the confirmation amounts yet and its been days. And now the app literally dosen't work at all, automatically trying to log out but glitching and showing me an error message. Called custom support, and while they were incredibly courteous, they weren't able to actually help at all."
20,"Used to work with my old bank (Simple) but after they jumped ship to BBVA Compass, I jumped to One Finance and Acorns doesn't support One Finance yet."
21,Its super hard to navigate in this app. It let's you do things that are in there favor.like link account and start deposit. But it's hard to find a way to turn off or remove the money you have in there back to your bank. Yes it can be done but it could be easier like other apps have it
22,"I'm trying to cancel my subscription, but my app insists that I can't because I have pending transfers. Invest your money elsewhere."
23,Unable to even get started! Will not let me change forgotten password and does not accept my capital one bank?? I was really looking forward to this app.
24,Not beneficial. My balance has dropped over the last month and I do not know why. I have emailed customer service with no reply regarding the money and also about the Earn Rewards that you're supposed to receive after a purchase through their chrome extension but the money has never been added. Spend another 20 minutes and check out some other online savings account before wasting your time and money with this.
25,"This is a horrible app. As I am writing this I am waiting for rhe customer support to respond to me. Over a month now I have been asking to reset my password so I can get into my account and nothing. I keep waiting for the email in my inbox it never comes.. do not use acorns... if its this had to get a password reset from them , what happens when I want my MONEY!!!!!"
26,"I created an account, had a code sent to my phone, entered the code, and the app froze as soon as it said ""Verifying Code"". I had to force close the app. I did this several times. Uninstalled, redownloaded, reinstalled... All the same results. I had to give up and delete the app altogether. Bummer, because this sounded great if it worked."
27,"They have a cash back program, just like Rakuten and Ibotta. Acorns is different though, IT DOESN'T WORK! I am owed over $200 in cash back. I have screenshots and receipts to prove it. I have contacted customer service NUMEROUS times. Sending screenshots, scans, etc. and after all the back and forth they put me through, I get a message saying they got everything and are sending my case to a manager. THEN...nothing...ghosted. every. time. I don't know why I keep using them. To invest ok, kinda."
28,"Address verification is hell. This process is a nightmare!! It's all automation by A.I. and can't differentiate my address vs the Xfinity bill's address. Then I submitted multiple bills in pdf format and was denied stating it was blurred.. 5 freaken attempts in different ways and they can't get it together. IMPOSSIBLE to talk to anyone, or chat with anyone even though there is a chat button once you select the topic it disappears. Even after I submitted my inquiry I received an automated email.."
29,"At this moment I don't have an experience review. However, from reading the reviews, the issues that are brought up are serious issues. These are extremely recent complaints, and the responses from the Acorn site doesn't give an update to the reviewer publicly about if the issue has been solved or how it been solved or what the issue was. Communication and prompt response to issues are way more vital than the benefits that the site promulgate."
30,"I finally decided to try this app again, after the last issue I had a while ago. Now im having another problem. I was able to create my account this time, but now I try to log in and it says incorrect password. I tried changing it but it keeps saying (change password token invalid). I cant seem to catch a break with this app. 😞"
31,"Terrible experience..and have only had it for 4 or 5 days..when I try to link my card, it always says can not connect to our server st this time...everytime..then I do link my card and they send the verifying amount to the wrong account...then when you email them, they don't get back to you...for an app that handles people's money, not very professional"
32,The customer service is awful! I sat in chat for 2 hours and it kept timing me out. Then recycled me back into the que. No option to cancel a transfer even though it says it can be done within 24 hours.
33,Hope and pray you don't have a dispute with a merchant with your cash card. I did and a week later it remains unanswered by Acorn. Your security seems unimportant to them. I would definitely recommend NOT using any cards from them! Thus I gave them one star. . I am hoping they are more responsive getting my money back to me when I close this thing out.
34,"Can't reset password, support is worthless. Looking to use Acorns again, created an account some years ago and haven't used it. Reset password option is broken and have tried numerous times from phone and laptop. You're supposed to receive an email with a link to reset but nothing is sent. Other people have had this issue. Emailing ""support"" is a waste of time, three different agents have emailed to ask me the same questions and have no idea what they're doing"
35,Doesn't explain what's going on with your money and what's being invested to what. If I could get my money back and leave acorn forever that would be great. But of course it's a long process to leave.
36,App was good but now I can't link debit card for round ups. Sucks to be charged for incomplete service.
37,I canceled my account a while ago and money is still being withdrawn. I can't contact anyone to fix this. I saw the withdrawl on my bank statement. I had to reactivate my account to get back in to try and take my card off and have to wait 48 hours. Why is money still coming out I dont even have the Acorns Ap on my phone anymore.
38,"Worked great until my account was mysteriously locked. Tried to reset my password, but never received a reset email. Nothing in my junk mail folder. Also tried the customer service contact form...but nothing. Update: Acorns support worked with me to unlock my account. But it was locked again a few weeks later...."
39,"#1, my bank account keeps coming unlinked and as a result, next to nothing is being invested. #2, not the app, but Acorns in general, I clicked the download link from the email regarding my 1099 and I ended up on the main page in the app. I poked around and couldn't find where to download it. After going to the website (no luck there) and back to the email, the link magically worked! Ya'll need to fix the bank unlinking problem because I googled it and it's been going on for a long time."
40,"App is unusable on Galaxy A71 5g. I enter the phone verification phone and I get a screen that says ""verifying"" and it never goes away and moves to the next screen. I have tried reinstalling, rebooting, and still nothing. Horrible especially after I gave them my personal banking information."
41,This apps entire functionality hinges on compatibility with your bank. A poor compatibility ensures you're ONLY able to pay fees. Don't waste your time regardless of how novel the only feature that drew you to this app sounds. Chances are high you'll never be able to use it.
42,"Acorns has generally been amazing. However, if you use their Spend services be in for a shock. They are at the whim of the bank they have partnered with. If you use Acorns to Deposit a check, be aware - If you happen to change your Primary account that Acorns is linked to, you have to wait 15 days (again) to be able to make a mobile deposit. Customer Service cannot help you and have refused to help."
43,The monthly cost is very high - you'd need to invest so much to offset %. Long term?! So much wasted $!! New investors better off learning to manually invest with companies without Acorns' fee structure. Spare change simply pays fees - just realistically automate amounts to savings and investing and keep your $. Low APY checking account not worth a monthly cost. Such slow balance updates bad for money management or those using this app sparingly. Customer service is either rude or unresponsive.
44,"I liked the idea but I hate that it suddenly made me pay for a subscription that I didn't want and I can't even cancel it because it keeps making transactions of 3 dollars from my bank, I can't even remove my bank either. I emailed the company twice and yet still no reply."
45,"They try to hide the fact that they charge $1 - $5 per month. It's not a ton, but trying to hide that from the consumer makes me not trust this as much. Plus, many other reviews have said the same thing. I'd rather have some features restricted and one-time buy a premium version or something, for like $3 or $5."
46,"Started investing again with Acorn and also opened up a Later account, only problem I have is that I have deposited 2 times already and still waiting for the deposit to show up! The money been taken out of my account and still waiting for it to show up to start investing. That's not cool might close the later account keep you updated."
47,"The Plaid verification service is the worst software possible. Makes verifying linking account extremely annoying and difficult! It'll straight up tell you your information is incorrect when it isn't. Even reseting info using Plaid supplied links, it'll still say incorrect! This is making me want to use a different service."
48,"I have had acorns for a couple years now and I have had numerous problems. I have disputed transactions multiple times and I never recieve any help or resolution, they make it so difficult to dispute a transaction its almost impossible. Also my card broke and acorns wouldn't replace it for months after multiple emails. I like the round up features but everything else sucks. Also deposits don't post during the weekend so don't expect any money quickly with them."
49,"Funding it is a pain if you don't use a major bank like Chase or Wells Fargo. I had Capital One linked & tried to switch to my credit union, which turns out it can't link with, & now Acorns won't let me go back to Capital One either. I've been wanting to consolidate my investments in Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, and Acorns. I was going to consolidate to Acorns but Robinhood is MUCH easier to use and they don't charge a fee. I've had Acorns since 2014, but it looks like I'll be closing out."
50,"Really bad experience, I have been with acorn for more than a year, and they advertised $600.00 for 3 referrals, I gave them the 3 referrals, they all qualified and deposited the money as advertised, but acorn never pay me the $600.00 I tried to email them several times, because that's the only way you can communicate with them, they told me a supervisor will call me back, but it has been weeks and nobody has contact me, I'll be moving my investment soon, don't trust acorn."
51,"Update 5/2021: Have been locked out of my account for a couple weeks now. Contacted their Support, and they asked me to verify some info, which I did. So a few days go by, and they email again stating they can't verify me!? They then wanted me to email them all my personal information. They have no # listed to call. Decent app, I enjoy the automatic transfers. Makes saving easy. I don't like how it regularly loses the link with my bank account, then have to keep re-linking it. It's a hassle."
52,"So first off this is a total sham, they charge you 3 dollars a week to literally help you save money, which is okay I guess, but if you need to take your money out you'll be waiting at least a week for it to hit into your accounts, no matter what. I tried to withdraw the money thinking okay it'll hit the account in three days( was super low on money in this account) long story short account went negative, nd because it bounced I got charged a 40 dollar fee from my bank, thank acorns"
53,"There is a bug in the app, when I tried to setup my account it fails to reconnect me after Linkining the bank and ask me again to reenter the whole information. Also I tried to skip the bank linking activity but it repeat the whole process again...plz fix asap. I'm using OnePlus Nord10, android 10."
54,I would rate this app as zero stars. Zero customer support. I can even set up an account as it says my ssn is invalid. Contacted customer support and only received an automated response. Zero trust in this app!
55,"The app is not working, I have made transactions but it has not transferred anything over. Also, I put my info in and it tells me, oops something went wrong! And support won't answer! Shm!!"
56,You need to fix the Bug problem!! it's been a month and still can't open the app!! There has been updates but that doesn't fix the problem!! I can only see my account on a desktop computer!!
57,"I can't add to the ""spend smarter"" section, a server error message comes up. It doesn't seem to be rounding properly. UPDATE: So apparently I accidentally canceled the card that says is enabled but now I can never be sent another one. Wow...."
58,"They make it very easy to sign up for services you might not want to be paying for at all. FYI im not referring to stocks or other items as the reply suggests, but acorns subscription services of varying levels across multiple areas of the app. I closed my account fully."
59,If this app at all worked like it's proposed method. It would be fantastic. It constantly unlinks my bank account. Won't stay linked for more than 24hrs. Like I said ideally this app makes fantastic sense. But does not preform how advertised.
60,"Constantly have to reset my password, everything I login the app thinks my password is wrong, which I know it isn't. Then I request a reset email and it never shows up...then I have to contact support and wait 3 days to get my problem resolved."
61,"Stay away! I closed my account and got a verification email stating that, days later Acorns withdraws money from my bank account (giving Acorns access to your bank account is a requirement of the app) , and I have yet to receive the money that was in my account when it closed. Acorn appears to be one of those apps where your money goes in but doesn't come out. BEWARE!"
62,Super high fees. Had it tied to my Google survey account and invested around twenty dollars. Lost my account for around a year. I logged back in close to a year later and fees had ate up almost all my money. They make the Robinhood app look user friendly. -2 of 5 stars.
63,1. Terrible customer service. 2. No place to make deposits except through the strict and lengthy processes. 3. Website and app that is hard to travers. Wish I could rate this zero zero zero.
64,I really want to give it five stars but not having their debit card that I signed up for and provided no solutions to amend it got me irritated. I'll still use the app and will change the rating if the situation improves.
65,I've put $70 on this almost a year ago maybe a little more. It's now currently sitting that $39. It also won't let me remove the money from the account so I can close it. I do not recommend this app at all or acorns for investing.
66,"Only had the app a week and it will not let me log in anymore. I'm sent the verification code through text, enter it, but it never verifys the code and stays stuck on the verifying code screen."
67,"My Acorns account was reopened weeks ago but the app apparently doesn't know that. It keeps asking me to go through the reopening process, a process that no one at Acorns seems to be notified about even though I've done it about a dozen times now. So the app is currently useless."
68,I cannot actually get into this app because after I log in and go to verify with my phone number the whole app freezes. I would really love to be able to use this app but it won't let me!!!!
69,"If your having difficulty closing your account make sure you do not select ""moving to another service"". Else it will 'Fail' to close your account."
70,Worst app ever.try and try to use the app every time I try to log into my account it tells me wrong password or email.i know what I put in and I save or write down my stuff.dont install I would have given no Stars but I have no choice.
71,Terrible app they just take your money better off just using your bank account atlest they don't take money without your permission. I've tried to cancel subscription three times now if they charge me again I'm going to flip.
72,"The round-up feature has been broken for 12 days. In those 12 days I've had to re-link my card 6 times! Even so, the round-ups remain broken. I'm not the only customer dealing with this so what are you guys doing to fix it??"
73,"Requires an update every time you want to use it, eventhnough change log is nebulous ""easier to use"" every time."
74,"If i could I'd give -5 stars, i had no problems but when i opened a new account and paused my investments which also acorns should know when my account is low on money but yet the app still took out money and overdraft my account"
75,"Just looking at the reviews tells me this is a terrible app was going to install but customers saying they auto pull out money, no investor info, no changing of goals looks like a terrible app maybe I'll look back into It in a year."
76,"Jesus christ. Stop making me log in with my email and password. Just use the biometrics, you retards. My phone autofills everything anyway, I just have to go through the extra, unnecessary, step of hitting the login button. Same for the stupid and pointless six digit code you send to verify it's me. My phone automatically copies the number and fills it in, and all I have to do is the extra, unnecessary, step of hitting login again. You are powerful stupid. Don't reproduce."
77,I heard acorns had a great amount to offer but literally for the past 14 hours I've tried getting past the verification code. I've tried sending the code through phone and email but neither work. it just says verifying code and then never does anything and I'm puttingthe code right like I'm doing what I'm supposed to. Its not a great first impression.
78,"What they don't tell you is you are actually loosing money unless you have a certain high amount invested. It costs 3$ a month, and in order to actually make 3$ a month from the app, you would need around $1000 to break even month to month. So for everyone who has less than that invested, they are stealing for ""acorns"" for all the hundreds of thousands of people who fit into that category, making them tons of money. Also the referral process for rewards is a scam, I'm still waiting on the money."
79,"Every time I stop automatic investments, Acorn decides to restart it when they get ready, now that's ridiculous."
80,The app has an astoundingly counterintuitive interface. Don't expect to find any relevent information on here without googling where to find it first.
81,"GREAT IDEA POOR EXECUTION No sense posting here. The same issue echoed by the masses over years. The same responses, unconvincing platitudes and apologies. Where are the fixes? Where are the improvements? THE REPETITIVE RESPONSES WITHOUT ANY TANGABLE CHANGES THE FALSE PLATITUDES FOR REPEATED FLAWS AND FAILURES THAT COST US THE INVESTORS. YOUVE ALWAYS GOTTEN YOUR MONEY AND WEVE GOTTEN ALOT OF APOLOGIES. LOOK AT YOUR REVIEWS APOLOGIES W/O CHANGE. IM SORRY FOR NOT CATCHING ON TO THIS SOONER."
82,Suspicious company. I was told to sign in again so I tried. It said my password was wrong which it wasn't. It said create a new password so I tried. It said my security question is wrong and it's not. Now I can't access my money and it's still withdrawing from my bank account. I'm calling the bank to have them block acorns. I get a bot response on here saying blah blah blah but haven't had a single response to an email I've sent them. Pretend elsewhere... I'll manually invest from now on.
83,I keep having too much of a hard time in the process of verification with acorns and reaching out to customer service doesn't seem to do much either
84,Easy to put money in but when you want to transfer they won't let you! Custer service just repeats an email of how to withdraw fund. Yeah I know how. You block it from going through!
85,"Literally everything I tried to do resulted in an error, making the app completely unusable. Couldn't be a customer even if I tried 🥲"
86,"This guy's are thieves, they can easily deduct money from your account but you cannot withdraw, on several occasions they said wait for account verification, like a they sent 2 deposits, it's been a month, on both occasions, i can't see any form of deposit from them, and definitely your account can't be verified, your money stocked with them, worst app, very stupid and a scamm., So so bad for common transactions."
87,I discontinued my use and took my information off of here yet for the last 6 months they been taking money from my account. Basically they have been stealing money from my bank account without my permission. From my experience i wouldn't sign up nor give out your personal and or bank account information becauseI cant not even get my money back. Cannot get anyone from there to respond to anything and still haven't stopped taking out money from my account which I closed at the first of the year.
88,"This app has been impossible to use. Haven't been able to do anything because the app is still "" varifying account"" for 2 months now. 2 months of roumd ups and weekly investments sitting there, wasted."
89,I did a withdrawal and the money was sent to the wrong account. Not happy with them at all!!!!!!
90,Subscription page will not load to allow to unsubscribe. Edit: Still zero assistance. Automated email responses.
91,"The Acorn investing app is not very user friendly, I would it invested but found it constricted and decided to remove my initial amount of money, including my daughter's early investing plan."
92,It hasn't been rounding up for over a month now. Can't give it a good rating when the app doesn't do what it should.
93,"This is a scam, as soon as my money was sent, I can't get into the site. Now the say they sent an email how to fix. Never got the email."
94,There is literally no customer support and when I do file it online ticket nobody gets back to you. I'm canceling my acorns account
95,At first was great but I canceled my reacting transaction and it keeps taking money out of my account
96,Maybe it's just not for me. Couldn't login even though I entered everything right. 🗑
97,"""Verifying code"" freezes the entire app every single time. Can't look at my accounts"
98,"I tried to verify my account by typing in the ""minimal deposit "" but it was never put in, so I can't withdraw,"
99,This app will not let me link my bank account or debit card for the Roundup. The link my bank account number to take a dollar out every month but couldn't link it with my debit card to do the roundups period seems like a scam to me
100,Horrible
101,"I am pretty sure they botted reveiws, so let me put a dent on it. You can check out all the other 1 star reveiws as they seem pretty legit."
102,Tried logging into one of my accounts and I can't log into it. I tapped Forgot Password and password didn't change. Unbelievable. Do not install.
103,MIT m
104,THE WORST APP EVER!!!!!!!
105,"DO NOT ATTEMPT A MOBILE CHECK DEPOSIT WITH THIS APP. THEY WILL LOCK YOUR ACCOUNT, IGNORE YOUR SUPPORT TICKETS AND KEEP YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!! $100 GONE that I needed to pay bills. All of the money in my retirement account. GONE. I'm talking to an attorney now, thank you!"
106,I downloaded acorm it wasted all my money I want my card to be unlink to the app .I can't even get in .
107,"Referral system is trash, i should be able to join and link the person that referred me instead of only using the specific link. Eat my poo poo developers"
108,"Deceptive marketing campaign which presents a realistic looking ad stating my ""invest account is worth $xxxx.xx"" within an ad on my phone. It's clearly meant to look like a notification. The fact that this company thinks this is an ok practice has completely steered me away from this app. Absolutely not. Not even once. Edit: Cute cut and paste response by your marketing team. Funny thing is, I completely forget about this POS app until the same thing happened 1 year later."
109,"The plaid program they use has my wrong phone number for my bank, even though my contact info on my bank is updated. Can't even use the app."
110,I've put $70 on this almost a year ago maybe a little more. It's now currently sitting that $39. It also won't let me remove the money from the account so I can close it. I do not recommend this app at all or acorns for investing.
111,"After 2 weeks they couldn't get my account going. I have other investment accounts, so I canceled."
112,"They've earned me about $10 over the past year. Doesn't matter how much I put in, it always gets lost the next day. It feels like such a waste of time and money."
113,They went connect to my bank for months again. They won't email me back after six attempts to transfer my retirement to here
114,"I'm trying to cancel my subscription, but my app insists that I can't because I have pending transfers. Invest your money elsewhere."
115,I want to withdrawal and you're app is making it intentionally difficult.
116,"Terrible customer service. Having the same issue with no resolution for over 1 year. Multiple calls, dozens of emails and nothing."
117,Doesn't explain what's going on with your money and what's being invested to what. If I could get my money back and leave acorn forever that would be great. But of course it's a long process to leave.
118,There is a typo in my name and the app does not allow me to fix it
119,Dont use this app! I have never had so much trouble withdrawing my own money! I have been trying to access and withdraw funds for over a month and everytime they lock my account!
120,as Z
121,This app is trash dont put any money into all it is honestly is a bunch of lazy thieves to lazy to get their own money
122,"Terrible customer service ... use ""terms and conditions"" as answers but cannot specify what they are!"
123,",, ■ Zz"
124,Unbelievable. I attempted at least 10 times to start a account and it kept- email not correct so I rechecked my phone and yep it was. so I went through all this nonsense about confirmation numbers. It Finally worked. Then it said my password was not correct. I went through everything and tried over and over. I Uninstalled..Then I tried it out again and couldn't even change it to a new password. This is too much hassle for me. I will just look for a different application that wants me.
125,Is not good investing
126,"Do not use this. I've had an account for maybe 5 years. I am low income student and had to switch to not depositing money. So far, it says my net gain is 200. Then I realized they somehow switched to charging me 2 dollars a month, and I don't even have acorns later set up. I go to switch to the lite plan (which is $1/mo) and the page freezes at the end every time, so I can't tell if the request is even submitted. On top of that, I'm not sure what they take when you close the account..."
127,Garbage
128,"Well unfortunately this issue has happened more than one time acorns failed to cash my check, I work paycheck to paycheck I need every last dollar to pay my rent, they make you write on the back or ""acorns Mobile deposit only"" and then you sit and wait two to three days for them to send an email saying we hit a snag cash in your check and no information thus far, now that made my check unusable and I had to wait to have another check reissued... No longer trusting acorns with my money!"
129,You just lost a loyal customer!! I try logging into my account and it says it's locked and needs further verification. No one can tell me why my account is locked.. I've sent countless verification forms via email and now they want to 3 way my bank in which I have to give personal info over the phone with them listening in!!?!?!?! Screw that! Put the money bank into the account in which it came from and close me out!! I'm done and beyond pissed!!!!!!
130,"Your customer service rep told me there was an upgrade & that was the reason why I've been experiencing issues with the app. Not to mention several ppl not just myself can't get accurate answers from customer service team nor can we get in touch with a supervisor. I've been a member for years, I've recommended others, the lack of service & ease to use this app is frankly unacceptable. U R about to lose a customer who believed in this company & if U R planning to go public U need to improve"
131,"Used to work with my old bank (Simple) but after they jumped ship to BBVA Compass, I jumped to One Finance and Acorns doesn't support One Finance yet."
132,"Had a terrible experience with their fraud department team. Horrible. Beyond that, the process from transferring money from your bank to it reflecting in your invest account is wayy too long. 6 days? Also, I can't for the life of me understand why there isn't a feature to transfer money from your Spend account to your Invest account? As much as I like the clean UI, and simplicity of the app [in regards to navigation], too many little things makes this a horrible experience."
133,",Just of for the together too t"
134,"Very shady customer service. I've talked to numerous people from customer service, all of them telling me different things, and none solving my issue or giving me an answer. The people i referred went through the same issue with customer service and had to talk to several people. Growing increasingly frustrated not only for not getting help, but for being told everything was good then being told something different after the 7/3 promo ended."
135,App was good but now I can't link debit card for round ups. Sucks to be charged for incomplete service.
136,"No Customer Support If U Got locked Out Good Luck With Your Money. The money grows like a snail 🐌 I only gain a pocket change one day you gain next day you lose. I'm not sure if Acorns have medical marijuana, CBD beverage, CBD Oils, and bitcoin like Moomoo & Webull app stocks on their list📃. If is available I don't see, what's the hold-backs? Acorns should be the head of game if it wants to be at the top.This what happen to taxi🚖 industry they Don't upgrade their system uber come & kill it."
137,Nc apps
138,Downloaded this app about a week ago and still won't verify?
139,"App is complete trash. Kept telling me my password was wrong even though I made a new google account and password. Then proceeds to tell me it can't take my social security after trying to long in for idk how long. Then sends me to customer support, for absolutly no help."
140,Having difficulties with linking to bank I have been trying for 2 flipping years now I just want to pull out!!
141,App sucks and won't give me my money or verify my account???? Stupid AF have some pride and be better Acorn
142,Hay que pagar una cuota mensual de la cual no tenia idea. Ahora tengo problema tratando de cerrar una de las cuentas.
143,No starts if I could Took money from me and now won't respond. Not to mention I didn't complete my account or give it a day to start taking for investing Costumer support absolutely sucks. Will take your money. I usually don't leave bad reviews but this is beyond ridiculous. Taking money I don't even have yet without permission. Bulls***. QUIT TAKING MY MONEY. F***
144,Not giving an unknown app my full ss#
145,"It's an interesting idea but their support is terrible, special offers are denied even if you do everything right on your end, and the UI can be very frustrating to navigate."
146,Rsww3.ses÷sessssssss2gs
147,useless.
148,Huge disappointment.
149,I have been trying to get the app to verify my bank account so I can start the round up but it always says there is something wrong with the server or when I proceed to verify it says it deposited some small amounts to my account but nothing is there. I uninstalled and installed again and nothing helped. I was really excited about getting this app to start investing but I'm just dissapointed now.
150,Misleading
151,Canceled service with them twice they continue to charge my card for services cannot get them out of my bank account
152,Can't create a new account and won't let me get into old account. Absolutely no help.
153,You never know where ur momey goes
154,Horrible you cannot re a ch a real person. I want to leave.this company.Now I have to get my bank to stop money from going to this company if they do indeed exist Cannot inform them that my email address has changed
155,"They don't seem to really build your portfolio. Not s fan, rather do Robinhood so I can choose my own path."
156,Why am I still being charged
157,I would be very cautious.
158,This app will not let me link my bank account or debit card for the Roundup. The link my bank account number to take a dollar out every month but couldn't link it with my debit card to do the roundups period seems like a scam to me
159,Sucks
160,They never told me they charge$5 monthly
161,"Terrible customer service, and God forbid you get there spend account card from them prepare to wait for a month or more . The other issue is if you lose your card and you have to get a replacement expect to wait another 2 months to receive a new one. Do not get Acorn save yourself the headache ."
162,👎 useless never use it you waist your money particularly it has monthly fee. Don't use it.
163,"What they don't tell you is you are actually loosing money unless you have a certain high amount invested. It costs 3$ a month, and in order to actually make 3$ a month from the app, you would need around $1000 to break even month to month. So for everyone who has less than that invested, they are stealing for ""acorns"" for all the hundreds of thousands of people who fit into that category, making them tons of money. Also the referral process for rewards is a scam, I'm still waiting on the money."
164,Terrible
165,"I've canceled my subscription 3 times and I'm still being charged monthly. Any profit you might make from this will get sapped away, not worth time and headache"
166,Hard to switch accounts. Make it too difficult
167,Do not download go invest in Amc an Gme to the moon
168,Horrible I accidentally put $50 into my auto invest instead of 5 and as soon as I caught it I tried to fix it ...they said to fix it but it's been over a week and a half and still nothing's done so I'm just taking all my money out and closing the account should I just fix the acorns!!!!😯😡😡😡😡
169,"Haven't been able to set up my investment account for a week since signing up. Says ""We weren't able to contact the server."" Unacceptable."
170,This app stole $5 from me even though I removed my banking info and even though I signed up for the $1 a month plan. Do not use this app they will scam and steal your money
171,B mändernö.Nääö
172,"WARNING!!!WARNING!!!WARNING!!!WARNING!!!!! DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! OMG, where do I begin? First off this app comes off extremely well and a great opportunity on paper, that is until you start putting money into it. They do crazy stuff with your money, like they'll just take money out of your account and not even leave a transaction record of it!! The DF's also suspended my ability to invest, due to ""low funds"", after I switched to an account that had 30 times MORE money than the prior working acc"
173,. M m . N m m ..? MSM lm mlm.. ni km. Mkm . Mmm...k. mlm Mmu... Mbv m. . . . L M9 .... .
174,Idk. I'm the short term I don't see the growth. It may display I'm up percentage but if I include they monthly subscription I'm at a loss. Idk I'm going to give it a little more time but.... We'll see
175,Cant even install the app
176,They're taking my money without my consent. I ask to be cancel they said they would but didn't steady taking my money. I asked the add my change to my account not take to invest.
177,Unable to even get started! Will not let me change forgotten password and does not accept my capital one bank?? I was really looking forward to this app.
178,Clunky and confusing.
179,It's trash
180,"Every time I stop automatic investments, Acorn decides to restart it when they get ready, now that's ridiculous."
181,If you are new to investing this is confusing and not much explanation.
182,3 days account still verifying..... Nice 2 days like it says
183,Yea this app sucks customer service sucks
184,Signed up canceled and they still take money out of my account. Wont stop
185,There is literally no customer support and when I do file it online ticket nobody gets back to you. I'm canceling my acorns account
186,Keeps asking for my password instead of fingerprint GETTING VERY BUGGY AND ANNOYING
187,Stuck on creating my account because of some error
188,"Literally everything I tried to do resulted in an error, making the app completely unusable. Couldn't be a customer even if I tried 🥲"
189,I have REV FEDERAL CREDIT UNION and Acorn is not compatible with my bank so I will not be using this app.
190,Its super hard to navigate in this app. It let's you do things that are in there favor.like link account and start deposit. But it's hard to find a way to turn off or remove the money you have in there back to your bank. Yes it can be done but it could be easier like other apps have it
191,Acorns customer support is horrible. Go with a real broker like fidelity.
192,"I downloaded this app at least a week ago. I set up my account immediately, but it won't let me set up the invest feature. I've tried and tried since I got it, but all it says is to try again in a few minutes. If I can't use the app for the one reason I downloaded it, what is the point of having it? There isn't one"
193,Had to change my review from 5 stars to one because they will not return email about transfers. The transfer was requested over a month ago and still hasn't happened. I liked acorns but wanted to have a little more control over my investments. I would have recommended them for completely hands off investors until this happened. But to not respond to 4 straight emails is rediculous. And I did receive an email saying that they had received my communication and would respond within 24 hours.
194,I am very pissed. I was curious and went through this app but never said yes or agreed to be charged but it still pulled money from my bank account. Shame on you for doing this. I will be calling and telling my bank to stop payment.
195,I'm getting money taken out of my bank from acorns and I dont even have the app installed anymore. I never even put any money into acorns so why am I getting charged money???
196,Terrible
197,1z is
198,"The app is not working, I have made transactions but it has not transferred anything over. Also, I put my info in and it tells me, oops something went wrong! And support won't answer! Shm!!"
199,S..j
200,"Received email stating address change. Don't have address set up. Tried to contact Mint\Intuit, impossible! Ended up changing accounts at bank and credit cards. Later in the day received email stating original email sent in error. Bank not going for it and refused to set up online banking for new account numbers unless I have phone professionally cleaned. Searched web to see if anyone posted about this. Nothing. Now have to change banks. They need much better customer service."
201,"Can't find a support email to notify so posting here. On Monthly overview screen the app wrongly says $200 left to spend this month, even though the detail budget says $200 over. When you're over budget the text still says congrats and spend more. Foolish for a budgeting app. Please fix. -Update- Response is inaccurate. Updated app and still shows incorrectly. No Twitter or Facebook on mobile and your URL isn't able to be copied. There's enough info here for someone to understand a fix. Goodluck"
202,Mint had completely ruined my Fidelity account. The individual investment account has been changed to checking and ALL of the transactions (I spent so much time editing) have disappeared. I can't believe years of information have now vanished. Not to mention the duplicate accounts and constant aggregation and connection errors. I think it's approaching the time to get rid of Mint - the constant hassles just aren't worth it.
203,"Hate the notifications inside the new app. They make zero sense and relate in no way to the old notification section nor do they have any reasonable logical relationship to the notification section in the website. Also, why does the app not have a help section or a feedback function inside? It's like you want me to come here and frustratingly ratings bomb your app."
204,You can't mark subscriptions as such and absolutely none of my monthly payments and subscriptions are being picked up. I had this issue with other Intuit apps not picking up my monthly payments for credit purposes. Absolutely ridiculous.
205,"App is not reliable at all. Half of the accounts never update correctly. The original app, before Intuit got hold of it, worked perfectly. I don't know what bugs they keep fixing with all of these updates because it never seems to get any better at updating accounts."
206,"Can't login. So far it gets a 1. I can't login. I have went round and round in circles. Login with a phone number, text verification, enter number...nada. login with email, change password, verify email...nada. login in with username, verify phone number with text and round and round and round....I gave up. 8 minutes of my life that I can't get back."
207,DO NOT DOWNLOAD. It wouldn't even give me a chance to create an account. It kept saying we cannot find a number to match this. I tried with email and same response. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. HORRIBLE APP.
208,"Categories are completely screwed up, would have to manually edit them constantly. Not everything I buy at a convenience store is gas, ridiculous."
209,"Why can't I take a dang screenshot?! Geez man, I need to do with MY information the way I chose. I get implementing perceived security measures, but damn man, I used this for expense reporting. Simple solution, dumping this service. Good thing my renewal is 2 weeks away."
210,"Update ruined this app, transactions no longer show up, the screen is filled with useless information and adds. Was much better before they did this stupid face lift. Mint is great as a desktop site but I don't think I will use the app again."
211,"Stopped working after years, contacted customer support for hours and they couldn't figure out the issue. 2 app updates later and still no luck."
212,Stiiiiiiiiilllll no dark mode. It's not just about battery. It's hard on my eyes. Please introduce a dark mode. It would be the greatest improvement in years.
213,"After the upgrade 6 months ago, it no longer displays my bills that are due. There's also many transactions that are named/labeled grossly incorrectly. This one started recently. I've contacted support a couple of times and tried what they suggested and still I'm having the same issues. Also they never got back to me with a solution like they said they would. It's time to search for an alternative app for bill management. I am very disappointed and frustrated with Intuit."
214,Doesn't function. Doesn't save changes. Forces you to link. Can't simply use the tracking options.
215,Updated: 1 year since 2 star review and we STILL can not edit assets like on PC! What am I missing? I'm thinking conditional logic programming shouldn't be to hard for a company like Intuit who has been utilizing CL for over a decade! Ridiculous. - original review: I still can't believe after all this time we still can't edit Assets via mobile. Back to Nerd Wallet I go.
216,"For Bills, it shows my 2 credit card bills each month but that's it. Doesn't show utilities or anything else. Not a huge issue though since I autopay basically everything. Subscription is even worse. I use Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime, a number of subscription apps. But the subscription feature is empty and doesn't recognize any of this despite years of data to look at. Am I missing something? I don't understand..."
217,"I'm always on the lookout for a Mint alternative. This is like hooking up with the guy who catcalls you and you get with him until something better comes along. The design stuff is ok, and the effort is appreciated...but it shows me inaccurate data. As of right now I CANNOT do basic simple things a human accountant could do 1. I can't add the purchase and sale of a property that happened in the past 2. I can't figure out why the networth graph on the main view of the app is so wildly wrong -- i can't find the transactions that make mint think i was worth a million dollars (i most defintely wasnt) 3. The networth graphs on the desktop page and the mobile app are at 180 degrees opposite of themselves and what the reality was 4. No annual or periodic budgets -- I have some recurring expenses that happen every year or quarter but my only options are to amortize them monthly, which is silly and not how that works in reality 5. i can't change the start of a loan transaction to happen in the past so the networth graphs show a huge spike in networth that never happened. If mint were a human accountant I would have fired them by now 3."
218,"I never found a support as bad as Mint'. I could not add a credit card because Mint system said ""password too long"". This is a glitch in their system since I use the same password to access the portal of this credit card. So the password is NOT too long as Mint says. Therefore I contact the support thorough the live chat. A support person called Jamila W. walks me through several checks and finally she says that I have to reduce the length of the password to 15 character because Mint says so. That is her solution. Seriously? So I tell her that that should not be a solution since they have a glitch in the system with that credit card and they should solve it. She repeats that I have to reduce my password. Then I say, please let me know how I can delete all information I have on Mint because I do not feel that Mint is complying with the most basic security protocols and she: hangs up on me!!!! Unbelievable!!!!!! I have no words!"
219,"Amazing app but unable to login anymore. Keep getting the error. Tried Uninstalling and Reinstalling too. Does not work. Will update review once the issue gets resolved Update: My account was disabled, to verify I needed to answer 5 questions (which I did) and now I need to upload my ID card. I refuse to upload any more personal information. I will not be using this app any more. Reason for disabling : Intuit performs regular security checks on all Accounts in our systems. When we notice any activity that appears unusual we will disable the account to protect the you and your data."
220,"This app is practically useless now. It was always slow and clunky, but now it's more style than substance. Accounts load so slow or not at all. Waiting ~10 mins for accounts to load is unreasonable. Don't share the feedback with your developers; they don't necessarily make decisions. Share it with product managers and business analysts that actually drive change. For such a well respected app, this iteration is embarrassing. Do better."
221,"I've been using this app for a while, but I've started to look at alternatives. The app doesn't update the accounts as it used to. Now it takes a long time and some of the accounts don't even update. On some accounts it doesn't even show payment dates even though it has access to the account. It's just not doing a good job at what it's supposed to be doing. Do not rely on this app for payment date reminders, connection issues and inconsistencies have cost me money."
222,If you install this app they will send you so much spam. They are actually really good at it. They know which flags to put into the email header code for Gmail to always mark it important. You literally have to go and make custom filters in Gmail to stop them from blasting you with notifications or just block their domain entirely. They already make so much money off your financial data I honestly don't feel bad for this criticism. Their marketing teams are highly skilled in how to annoy people.
223,"The app has been increasingly inaccurate, and has recently been duplicating some transactions more than once. It sometimes sees transactions that are not on any bank statement, and completely miscalculates my subscriptions (it believes I am paying $19 a month to netflix when I am paying just shy of $10). I really want to like using mint, because it was very useful when I first downloaded it, but now I am looking for alternatives because it's just completely unusable."
224,"I used to enjoy using Mint, but since the last update I have been having trouble using fingerprint login and cannot access my budgets. I even had trouble loading all my account information. Lots of bugs on the main page also. I'm disappointed. Please fix this asap!"
225,"Can't get passed the login. After the username is entered, I prove that I'm not a robot and it sends me right back to enter my username again."
226,"Mobile database gets bogus transactions that appear in search box but don't yield any search results so you can't delete them. No auto-categorization for investment accounts. Many transactions come in all upper case, can't change that. Transactions with & are saved on mobile differently than on desktop. Can't edit pending transactions on mobile but can on desktop. What's the point to contact customer support for any of these issues if it'll go nowhere either way???"
227,"After newest update: Goals still do not show up in the app... This needs to be fixed. Also still not fixed: accounts that I have selected to be hidden keep reverting themselves to unhidden, which is so annoying and messes up the net worth trend. Not happy with these bugs. Previously followed directions provided by developer and contacted customer service, but neither resolved the issue."
228,"It somehow put nonremovable notifications every week on my calendar forever re: credit reports. UPDATE: the app has now removed all record of all the accounts I'd spent an hour loading, SO, Mint has helped me save negative one hour. Great work. UPDATE 2: they're back now, I guess? Amazing."
229,"Interactive Brokers stopped working, Webull stopped working several months ago, no requested integrations are done. After the recent update I'm switching to Nerdwallet."
230,"I find this app incredibly hard to use, it doesnt link to my accounts it just lists them. The pretty pictures u see before u install the app is not at all what happens when ur actually in the app so, false advertising and back to pen and paper, it was less frustrating than this. It has the makings of great functionality but is very limited in actually connecting ypur accounts for an accurate view of spending vs. Bills owed"
231,"Ok for account aggregation, except some cash positions in brokerage accounts are MISSING. Horrible (buggy) for investments. In the mobile app I can't see individual positions - only transactions. Reporting bugs to Mint is time consuming, and they really don't want to deal with them. Things don't add up - literally. Investment data can not be relied upon. Positions are missing. Price reflects the date the position was added in Mint, but not true cost basis. Total garbage."
232,Deletes all my balances daily have to spend 30 to 45 minutes redownloading data. Very frustrating was a 5 but this is getting very old. I've been using mint for 4 years. Fix it. I should log in and see all my info not $0 in every category. This only happens on the app not on the website.
233,Outage support is not good. Turn around time they say is 1-2 weeks. Totally unacceptable especially when we are in tax season. Really disappointed. Update : I wrote this review after contacting Mint support 3-4 times and getting same response. Not sure how seriously they take customers. Update 2: Been more than a month and they have still not fixed the connection issue. Not sure they are serious about serving their customers.
234,Awful app. Used to be good but can't even view a list of the bill reminders I've created to remove one or plan ahead more than the few it shows on the overview screen. Tapping the bill reminder section just brings up a list of transactions it thinks are bills. None of those have ever been useful and are usually reminders I've already set but can't see unless they're a few days away. Look for a better financial app. Mint is garbage
235,"Can't even use the app. When I tried to sign up apparently my email was already registered. Tried to reset my password but all the customer support portals are down, they don't have a phone number and even their website chat is unreachable on my computer and phone. This seems like a bad company to trust with you financial information."
236,"Just a lurker who has never written a review, that I recall. Can't use the app. Can't log in. Choose the account. Wait minutes for email pin. Insert pin then enter password. Use authenticator to get pin for app. Enter that in. Accepts it and then just asks for another pin. Don't think about closing the app you can't log into at this point, you'll have to rinse repeat this entire process for no change at all. You guys still develop over there?"
237,"Updating my review from 2 stars to 1 star. Transactions are no longer showing for main credit card, and my investment account isn't updating at all. I tried reconnecting my investment, but there is about 5 different links (mostly Canadian) and not one of them works. I thought this was a professional app, but if it's this sloppy, I can only imagine what other issues this app will have."
238,I liked this app back when I used it regularly but I am now attempting to get back into my account and I can't reset anything it gives me 404s for trying to open the customer support page and attempting to update my phone number ended in the same. Why can this app not have a proper password reset like everything else in existence?
239,Design wise I like the last update but there are missing components that make it much less useful to me. I can't view my month by month spending and no longer have the option to view categories.
240,"Very frustrating. Constant revolving door of issues with sync, duplicate information, and worthless ads. Had to delete and recreate links to banks and others at least three times in past 6 months. Save yourself the endless headaches and dont bother. Also, personal capital is a scam... as i looked at personal cap as an alternative, their reps began calling to offer scammy services. Mint also routinely makes you reauthenticate your links, sending text to make sure its you, hoop after hoop."
241,"Customer support is atrocious. I've got an account for which Mint displays the wrong balance - not much of a personal finance app if the data is literally wrong. I've reached out to support twice so far and spent 30-60 minutes each time trying to help them even *understand* what's wrong. As you might imagine, they certainly haven't fixed it yet. Incredibly frustrating"
242,Still did not add banks I requested or all the goal options available on the website to the app.
243,Unsatisfied. Connected my bank account. Had to do it twice for it to actually show up. Didn't bring most things such as investments and only shows 1 month of past transactions. Kinda useless for a budget. Overall very disappointed.
244,"I tried to link my bank account, and it got as far as recognizing that I was signed up with my bank for 2FA and texting the code. When I entered the code, I got the message that no such account was found and my bank account might be closed. I know it hasn't been closed, because I've logged in multiple times! When I contacted customer service, they said they would check and send me an email when it's fixed. It's been well over a week and no email. This app is unusuble for me w/o bank access!"
245,"Its bad... Cant find support for what i need. Im stuck in a loop of ""wrong pasword"", ""locked account"", ""change password"", ""wrong password"", ""im sorry, you dont exist."" ""The account that doesnt exist is now locked"". Dont use it."
246,"Mint is great but with the new UI we lost the ability to bulk close notifications, which is extremely annoying. Changing review to one star until that is fixed. Closing notifications one by one is a huge waste of time."
247,New version feels like a setback. Too much whitespace requires a lot of vertical scrolling to view account balances. Red dot notification icon is maddening ... it's always lit due to useless alerts. Can't turn it off.
248,"Used to really like this app, but now I can't even log in because ""it can't connect to the server."" So annoying, I've used many Intuit services without issues, so what's up with the app?"
249,"Just downloaded the app to give it a shot and it literally just freezes on the ""Intuit Mint"" screen. Have tried force closing and relaunching multiple times and nothing. Will update if this gets fixed. Will continue using Nerd Wallet for now I guess."
250,Can't even get started on the app without linking a bank account. What if I want to check the app's features out before I decide to use it or not? What if I'm tracking cash expenses?
251,Update: And now 1 star for a dumb response. Refreshing your app isn't going to make it do things it is not programmed to do. Old : I spoke too soon. This still won't show all of my upcoming bills. It keeps saying I have more than the bank says is actually there never the actual balance up front. Have to go search for it. Not finding this helpful at all. Having it all on a notepad would be more helpful at this point.
252,Honestly I just need to cancel this account but anytime I try to it doesn't recognize my password and when I try to make a new one and then put in my new password it doesn't accept it. Also there is no contact number to call them for. CANCEL MY ACCOUNT!
253,"Ever since the last update, half of my bills are no longer showing on my calendar. No longer getting notifications of due dates on bills either. The customer service was no help at all. After years of using this app, I'm getting rid of it."
254,"I would love to use this app, it looks like exactly what I need. However, it won't connect to my credit union. It always just says my credit unions website is under maintenance, which it most definitely is not."
255,"Had to reset my phone and I cannot log in for the life of me. Was super convenient to track everything, but it's kinda useless if I can't get in."
256,"It won't even let me sign in. I keep getting an error message saying ""Looks like you use a different ID."" Try..... and gives the email that I am attempting to log in with."
257,"I like the app, I forgot my password and I can't get back in. When I try to change my pw I get sent to another page to re-enter my pw that I don't remember. Then when I try to locate the website that link says page not found.... If I can't get assistance I will be deleting soon"
258,"My review was taken down for an unknown reason. 1 star because it no longer connects to my bank and when asking for help, I am only pointed to a website saying it has been a known issue since MARCH."
259,"It has very limited options in the app. It needs custom search fields with dates, rather than only allowing you to view by month."
260,"Cant use it bc i cant sign in. Cant contact customer support bc the link to do so takes me to a server that doesn't exist. Can receive an email code to verify, only to be asked to also verify with a text code. But i never get a text message."
261,Keep getting notifications i have a bank fee even though I don't. You removed the budget feature which was basically the main reason I used this app. Uninstalling - this app isn't useful at all anymore!
262,They removed budgets for the past months from the app with the latest update. This was the main tool to analyze your spending. So now essentially this app is useless
263,"Used to be fine. But a lot of issues lately. First, it fails to update info. Then logging in becomes almost impossible (with correct info) after restalling the app."
264,I've used this app for years and loved it but now it won't let my update my manually added bills and its super frustrating. I've done the uninstall and re-download but it doesn't fix the issue
265,Mint is having more and more issues lately. Regularly removes half the accounts we have connected. It's becoming more inconvenient than convenient having the app.
266,"Intuit seems unable to send a verification text or email me a 6 digit verification code. When I click to contact customer support, I get a website out of app that generates a 404 error. If I haven't already trusted Intuit with my taxes, there's no way I'd trust them with all my bank and loan data. This is just a really poor showing for Intuit and Mint specifically."
267,Mobile App is a wrapper for a Web Browser It looks like the latest set of updates to this app is nothing more then a wrapper for the Android web browser instead of Android system components.
268,Infinite login for the last time. I cannot rely on mint
269,"Annoying. It's demanding I link bank accounts when I try to use it on tablet, but not phone. I can do stuff on phone but not tablet."
270,Keep getting an error 103 despite having correct user names and passwords. Doesn't matter which account it is. Please fix.
271,"The webpage is way better. This is pretty much a platform to deliver ads directly to the user. Of course none of them are relevant, but intuit is probably making a killing off of them."
272,My password or username never works and when trying to change either I never get an option to change the password or user name. So it's definitely not user friendly..
273,Since the last update. I do not like the new layout and it seems to be as not user friendly as before. I don't like how it delete previous months spending.
274,This app is terrible on Android. My goals don't update and there are pending transactions hanging since 2018 Edit Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still doesn't work.
275,Fix the issue with 2FA on Webull & Paypal and I'll fix my review. I've been patiently waiting for months for the problem with Webull to be resolved. Otherwise a 5 star app.
276,"I can't log in. Asking for an Intuit password, but no way to access/reset forgotten password. Big miss."
277,Great company to work with. However app technology is 🤡 User Id & Password field doesn't allow user/pass auto fill.
278,This Mint Budget app won't let me get passed the step where you link a bank account. It looks like they require that you link a bank account in order for you to use their app. I would sure like to manage my finances without having to link a bank account. What are people going to do if their bank isn't compatible with your app?
279,"They've updated it to be much harder to use, I'm trying to find a specific type of transaction and mint won't let me search by keyword"
280,The new updates are terrible. Everytime they update the app my account doesn't work and I have to reset it.
281,Account website link has been broken for 5 months with no fix and no estimated solution date.
282,I used to be able to lock the app with a pin. Security feature no longer appears to be available. Can this be fixed?
283,Disabled autofill for passwords. That's an instant 1 star rating since it's a terrible security practice.
284,Every time you visit this app it asks to update the app itself not sure if it's really a bug in their software or that is how it's built.
285,Budgets are completely wack compared to the correct desktop site.
286,"First thing is asks me to link is my bank... Yet my bank isn't on the list and when you try to search no banks show up, nothing happens, waste of time."
287,"The worst part is when you try to delete your account... Account services unavailable, please try back later."
288,Can't get past the welcome screen!
289,It's a waste of time. They offer all these features but they force me to use an app to see them. It's a terrible strategy that I do not appreciate.
290,I don't like it because there doesn't seem to be a way for me to set up spending accounts the way I would like to and they way they are set up are way off. I will not use this as it is not helpful to me.
291,Mint stopped tracking any purchases in the last update.
292,"I had a account with them since 2016 all of a sudden in may 16 2021 all my information and account info doesn't exist anymore n I can't access this.... And my TurboTax account which I used may 13, can't access it n the IRS rejected my taxes... I need to file my taxes ASAP... HORRIBLE never using TurboTax a wastes of money I'm better off paying some 1 to file it."
293,The inability for the app to remember to keep one of my accounts hidden is maddening.
294,"Intuit is fighting against tax reform and scamming people into paying for services that should be free by law. Also, dark mode is missing..."
295,"What happened to this app? For months now I log on, wait for it to update to the present moment and it just won't do it. Every account I have remains stuck for days on end. What's the point? Are you trying to frustrate users? Do you hate us?"
296,"I can't link my bank to mint, it keeps telling me to check my info, i call my bank and they said everything is good on there side so it must be mint."
297,I installed and then started reading the reviews. I quickly uninstalled. Bet you were great but to many ppl no longer do.
298,"Ballances don't add up. If Mint can't add four numbers correctly, why should I trust anything else the app tells me? Links from emails also don't direct to the relevant information in the app. Mint used to be helpful for keeping tabs on accounts, but it fails at basic functionality now and is mostly for pushing credit card and mortgage promotions."
299,"I can't link my debit card account, so what's the point? I've tried twice to link my main bank account, the one where my job direct deposits my pay, and it just won't figure it out. If it can't link that, what's the point? It shifts all my info so that nothing is correct unless I go in manually to fix it. In that case I might as well just go back to my excel budgeting system."
300,I cannot find the purpose of this app. It wants access to all my c/c and bank accounts. Yet it gives me no ability to build budgets and/or input anything. Not only is it useless. It seems to be a security risk. I have deleted the app. I hope it also removes my info.
301,The bad reviews scared me away. The good reviews seemed scripted. This app feels sus. New people do your research first before getting this app.
302,Haven't really used it that well that much
303,"This app has major glitches and linking issues. I can't even connect one bank account, it just keep redirecting me to the log in page. Frustrating and not worth the time."
304,You can't mark subscriptions as such and absolutely none of my monthly payments and subscriptions are being picked up. I had this issue with other Intuit apps not picking up my monthly payments for credit purposes. Absolutely ridiculous.
305,"Terrible - can't connect CapOne, poor support, features get worse..."
306,Can't get past the welcome screen!
307,How can I see trends... Don't like the new interface
308,Another financial scare app. Avoid!
309,"Ever since they merged with Intuit, I've been locked out of my account. Can't reset password or even verify that my account exists."
310,I hate it😡😡🤬🤬
311,Stiiiiiiiiilllll no dark mode. It's not just about battery. It's hard on my eyes. Please introduce a dark mode. It would be the greatest improvement in years.
312,"The moment you cannot link an account that you use often, this app is useless. You better use the banks and services they are prepared for or else it's not accurate."
313,"Can't get passed the login. After the username is entered, I prove that I'm not a robot and it sends me right back to enter my username again."
314,"Intuit is fighting against tax reform and scamming people into paying for services that should be free by law. Also, dark mode is missing..."
315,Didn't track all my expenses by price and due dates which is the main reason I downloaded it based on that advertisement. I uninstalled.
316,Most recent update involved a popup that installed adware
317,Infinite login for the last time. I cannot rely on mint
318,"Hate the notifications inside the new app. They make zero sense and relate in no way to the old notification section nor do they have any reasonable logical relationship to the notification section in the website. Also, why does the app not have a help section or a feedback function inside? It's like you want me to come here and frustratingly ratings bomb your app."
319,"Received email stating address change. Don't have address set up. Tried to contact Mint\Intuit, impossible! Ended up changing accounts at bank and credit cards. Later in the day received email stating original email sent in error. Bank not going for it and refused to set up online banking for new account numbers unless I have phone professionally cleaned. Searched web to see if anyone posted about this. Nothing. Now have to change banks. They need much better customer service."
320,My bank app does the same thing for the most part & is more accurate. I want a real budgeting calendar.
321,"Update ruined this app, transactions no longer show up, the screen is filled with useless information and adds. Was much better before they did this stupid face lift. Mint is great as a desktop site but I don't think I will use the app again."
322,"I wasn't able to sign in. It keeps telling me I have an account, I don't remember using this before, but it won't let me change the password or verify me another way."
323,DO NOT DOWNLOAD. It wouldn't even give me a chance to create an account. It kept saying we cannot find a number to match this. I tried with email and same response. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. HORRIBLE APP.
324,"My husband and I use mint to track our joint expenses and budgets, and you can't see lists of transactions or look at other months from the app. It is honestly pretty useless unless you just want to see a pie chart of your budgets."
325,found it very invasive and companies using this app for paydays etc. should be prosicuted I closed my account I felt so violated
326,"Can't login. So far it gets a 1. I can't login. I have went round and round in circles. Login with a phone number, text verification, enter number...nada. login with email, change password, verify email...nada. login in with username, verify phone number with text and round and round and round....I gave up. 8 minutes of my life that I can't get back."
327,Waste of time
328,"Why can't I take a dang screenshot?! Geez man, I need to do with MY information the way I chose. I get implementing perceived security measures, but damn man, I used this for expense reporting. Simple solution, dumping this service. Good thing my renewal is 2 weeks away."
329,Intuit has begun using notifications to send advertisements for cryptocurrency. Avoid.
330,Didn't work at all.
331,"Can't find a support email to notify so posting here. On Monthly overview screen the app wrongly says $200 left to spend this month, even though the detail budget says $200 over. When you're over budget the text still says congrats and spend more. Foolish for a budgeting app. Please fix. -Update- Response is inaccurate. Updated app and still shows incorrectly. No Twitter or Facebook on mobile and your URL isn't able to be copied. There's enough info here for someone to understand a fix. Goodluck"
332,"Categories are completely screwed up, would have to manually edit them constantly. Not everything I buy at a convenience store is gas, ridiculous."
333,Doesn't function. Doesn't save changes. Forces you to link. Can't simply use the tracking options.
334,"App is not reliable at all. Half of the accounts never update correctly. The original app, before Intuit got hold of it, worked perfectly. I don't know what bugs they keep fixing with all of these updates because it never seems to get any better at updating accounts."
335,UNINSTALLED FOR INVASION OF PRIVACY ON MY PHONE!
336,Honestly I just need to cancel this account but anytime I try to it doesn't recognize my password and when I try to make a new one and then put in my new password it doesn't accept it. Also there is no contact number to call them for. CANCEL MY ACCOUNT!
337,Can't even get started on the app without linking a bank account. What if I want to check the app's features out before I decide to use it or not? What if I'm tracking cash expenses?
338,"Would rather not link all my accounts to this one app. Edit: if there were options to manually enter information, my review would be different. If there are, it was not user friendly thus leading me to search other apps as my time is valuable."
339,This company treats their employees like DOGSHIT
340,"Interactive Brokers stopped working, Webull stopped working several months ago, no requested integrations are done. After the recent update I'm switching to Nerdwallet."
341,The new update deleted some of my accounts and it is not user friendly.It simply sucks. I am worried that I will be missing my bill payments cuz of this update. I got to look for a new Bill Manager.
342,This is not accurate. Found out my credit score was almost 50 points HIGHER through my Credit Union. This app is garbage and is not worth the time or investment
343,"The app just gets worse and worse. I can't break out my spending into subcategories?? So, for example food and dining is one category? Don't you think I'd want to know how much I spent on groceries vs eating out without having to go to the web app? This is basic stuff here folks."
344,Junk
345,"Stopped working after years, contacted customer support for hours and they couldn't figure out the issue. 2 app updates later and still no luck."
346,Mint had completely ruined my Fidelity account. The individual investment account has been changed to checking and ALL of the transactions (I spent so much time editing) have disappeared. I can't believe years of information have now vanished. Not to mention the duplicate accounts and constant aggregation and connection errors. I think it's approaching the time to get rid of Mint - the constant hassles just aren't worth it.
347,Says I have an account but can't log into it? And won't let me reset the password? What?
348,Hard to believe that a budget app can't have multiple users.
349,Still did not add banks I requested or all the goal options available on the website to the app.
350,It's a waste of time. They offer all these features but they force me to use an app to see them. It's a terrible strategy that I do not appreciate.
351,Budgets are completely wack compared to the correct desktop site.
352,Updated: 1 year since 2 star review and we STILL can not edit assets like on PC! What am I missing? I'm thinking conditional logic programming shouldn't be to hard for a company like Intuit who has been utilizing CL for over a decade! Ridiculous. - original review: I still can't believe after all this time we still can't edit Assets via mobile. Back to Nerd Wallet I go.
353,The updated app is garbage
354,Design wise I like the last update but there are missing components that make it much less useful to me. I can't view my month by month spending and no longer have the option to view categories.
355,"all I get is a ""failed to connect to server"" error these days... does this app even work anymore?"
356,Unsatisfied. Connected my bank account. Had to do it twice for it to actually show up. Didn't bring most things such as investments and only shows 1 month of past transactions. Kinda useless for a budget. Overall very disappointed.
357,"Update: Mint has now started dropping accounts and then when it rediscovers them it creates a duplicate. Unfortunately after 10+ years Mint still can't merge duplicate accounts(!!!) Basic features like searching over a date range are still missing. Incredibly, automatically categorizing transactions has gotten *worse*; the app regularly miscategorizes or forgets assignments. The app has a fraction of the web site functionality, replaced by ads and sponsored ""advice"". Horrible."
358,"The webpage is way better. This is pretty much a platform to deliver ads directly to the user. Of course none of them are relevant, but intuit is probably making a killing off of them."
359,This app did not show the correct balances on my crypto portfolio and when I tried to get customer service to help they told me there was nothing they could do.
360,Everybody wants to help me spend my money
361,"After the upgrade 6 months ago, it no longer displays my bills that are due. There's also many transactions that are named/labeled grossly incorrectly. This one started recently. I've contacted support a couple of times and tried what they suggested and still I'm having the same issues. Also they never got back to me with a solution like they said they would. It's time to search for an alternative app for bill management. I am very disappointed and frustrated with Intuit."
362,It forces you to add accounts and information you don't want to put in it. No control over what you want them to know.
363,Keeps wanting me to verify accounts. It never remembers that I've already verified. Horrible app I'm not on FB or Twitter. Your own email department said there is nothing that they can do. Defeats the whole purpose if I have to two factor authenticate every time it refreshes. Great app but waste of time
364,"I can't log in. Asking for an Intuit password, but no way to access/reset forgotten password. Big miss."
365,The new updates are terrible. Everytime they update the app my account doesn't work and I have to reset it.
366,"Can't even use the app. When I tried to sign up apparently my email was already registered. Tried to reset my password but all the customer support portals are down, they don't have a phone number and even their website chat is unreachable on my computer and phone. This seems like a bad company to trust with you financial information."
367,"For Bills, it shows my 2 credit card bills each month but that's it. Doesn't show utilities or anything else. Not a huge issue though since I autopay basically everything. Subscription is even worse. I use Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime, a number of subscription apps. But the subscription feature is empty and doesn't recognize any of this despite years of data to look at. Am I missing something? I don't understand..."
368,Used the app for a while but seems like the functionality and features keep getting clawed back
369,Every time you visit this app it asks to update the app itself not sure if it's really a bug in their software or that is how it's built.
370,"Just a lurker who has never written a review, that I recall. Can't use the app. Can't log in. Choose the account. Wait minutes for email pin. Insert pin then enter password. Use authenticator to get pin for app. Enter that in. Accepts it and then just asks for another pin. Don't think about closing the app you can't log into at this point, you'll have to rinse repeat this entire process for no change at all. You guys still develop over there?"
371,Couldn't even create an account. Keeps saying code expired or incorrect when I literally just received it..
372,Crashes on singup page (moto e5 play)
373,"App has just been falling apart over time. Some thing update. Some don't. Can no longer depend on it for a full picture. Also asks for terms agreement every time you open it and asks you to update whether there is a new update or not. You all should consuder backing out a lot of the updates just so you can get back to a proper, functional app. For me, Mint has become unusable. I've been on it for like 10 years..."
374,"Mobile database gets bogus transactions that appear in search box but don't yield any search results so you can't delete them. No auto-categorization for investment accounts. Many transactions come in all upper case, can't change that. Transactions with & are saved on mobile differently than on desktop. Can't edit pending transactions on mobile but can on desktop. What's the point to contact customer support for any of these issues if it'll go nowhere either way???"
375,Fix the issue with 2FA on Webull & Paypal and I'll fix my review. I've been patiently waiting for months for the problem with Webull to be resolved. Otherwise a 5 star app.
376,Awful app. Used to be good but can't even view a list of the bill reminders I've created to remove one or plan ahead more than the few it shows on the overview screen. Tapping the bill reminder section just brings up a list of transactions it thinks are bills. None of those have ever been useful and are usually reminders I've already set but can't see unless they're a few days away. Look for a better financial app. Mint is garbage
377,"Had to reset my phone and I cannot log in for the life of me. Was super convenient to track everything, but it's kinda useless if I can't get in."
378,I used to be able to lock the app with a pin. Security feature no longer appears to be available. Can this be fixed?
379,Constant force closing
380,First download. App crash on account creation.
381,"Used to be fine. But a lot of issues lately. First, it fails to update info. Then logging in becomes almost impossible (with correct info) after restalling the app."
382,Keep getting an error 103 despite having correct user names and passwords. Doesn't matter which account it is. Please fix.
383,So defcult to make an account
384,Can't log in with 2FA. Help link went to a 404.
385,I can't add wells fargo no matter what way I go about it. Pretty useless since that's step 1.
386,Downloaded and spent 30 min trying to get it to link with my bank account. Couldn't even get past that step. Immediately uninstalled.
387,I'm about ready to get rid of this because it won't keep the fingerprint or pin code enabled.
388,"I heard so much about this app, but it caters for only US and Canada. What about the Caribbean, like Jamaica and Trinidad? I am disappointed 😞😞😞😞😞 I tried adding my Jamaican Bank account and nothing"
389,"Annoying. It's demanding I link bank accounts when I try to use it on tablet, but not phone. I can do stuff on phone but not tablet."
390,Absolutely hate turbo tax and mint I am being charged 130 dollars for them doing my taxes this past year and the IRS is saying they never filed them and still want me to pay and can't get customer service to help me after trying to get them to over four different attempt's
391,"Ok for account aggregation, except some cash positions in brokerage accounts are MISSING. Horrible (buggy) for investments. In the mobile app I can't see individual positions - only transactions. Reporting bugs to Mint is time consuming, and they really don't want to deal with them. Things don't add up - literally. Investment data can not be relied upon. Positions are missing. Price reflects the date the position was added in Mint, but not true cost basis. Total garbage."
392,Full of glitches. Tried connecting several bank accounts several times. I would do the correct steps and it would just refresh itself back to the account connect page. The reviews were right. You guys need a new development team. This is pitiful.
393,"I can't login, there is an error no matter what I try, Still same issue, could be because I'm on Android 12 deta"
394,Can't sign in for day's now says client error
395,Can't log in and no support 😕
396,I installed and then started reading the reviews. I quickly uninstalled. Bet you were great but to many ppl no longer do.
397,I don't like it because there doesn't seem to be a way for me to set up spending accounts the way I would like to and they way they are set up are way off. I will not use this as it is not helpful to me.
398,"Just downloaded the app to give it a shot and it literally just freezes on the ""Intuit Mint"" screen. Have tried force closing and relaunching multiple times and nothing. Will update if this gets fixed. Will continue using Nerd Wallet for now I guess."
399,It sucks because turbo tax sucks and it does not make it easy to track your credit score
400,"Join with caution. Personal Capital has been unable to connect to Zillow like they once did. Known issue that they haven't fixed for 6 months. A home is often ones largest investment. If they cant care for that, they'll never achieve their goal of managing our investment portfolio. Also, they frequently have problems connecting to our financial institutions to update our activity - so accuracy of data is always in question."
401,Can't even login to use the app... See: every other 1 star rating. Such a bummer.
402,"Overall I love this app. It provides a lot of detail for all of my accounts I link up. It has helped keep me in touch with my finances. And offered advice on my investments. But the reason for the 1 stars instead of 5 rating is because every time I log in, (no joke - every time...) I have to re-sync my Capital One accounts. Code and all. It makes me not want to use this app, honestly. Please fix this! I uninstalled this app for the reasons above. Nothing kept linked. Too much work."
403,"I have used This app for over 2 years now and find it unreliable and a complete waste of my time. 4 months now accounts fail to update. I keep submitting requests on the issue. a few weeks go by and they close the request saying it is solved when infact it is not. This app is a complete waist of my time. Quicken, here I come."
404,"Been a user for years, suddenly cannot login to mobile app. It sends me to a new captcha check, then when I finish, it sends me to an error page saying the page doesn't exist. It then prompts me to download the mobile app, but is recommending the apple app store download even though I have a samsung android phone. Total fail here on the update guys. Can't even access my data on mobile anymore, where is your QA department in all this? Please get rid of the captcha check until fixed!"
405,"One year later, still offers a complete lack of connectivity to banks it says it supports, and has not resolved these issues despite numerous reports. Other apps do not have these issue with the same banks. Perpetually unresolved."
406,"Used to be great and helped me become debt free. But lately I keep getting a captcha to log in but then it either takes me to a page that doesn't exist or tells me my device isn't supported. Then it'll work like normal for a day or two, then I'll get the captcha thing again and it's useless for a day or two. Frustrating. Fix it. (Update: I've decreased my rating further because it is still happening constantly. Makes the app unusable.)"
407,Needs work. I had to keep logging in for capital one and wells Fargo. Then I forgot my password for personal and resetting itself is a project. It took 15 attempts thru personal just to reset my password.
408,"App only work on some android devices. If you are unlucky, you will get stuck on a page stating ""Please complete this additional verification step in order to access Personal Capital Please stand by, while we are checking your browser..."""
409,push notification ads :(
410,"I rated this with only 1 star because although the functionality is there, I was only able to add some of my accounts. I suppose it has something to do with getting hungup on security (which I like) but there is no way to finally enter the additional security info. There is a link for but it doesn't do anything. So I am still left without a complete summary of my personal capital which was the whole purpose for me to download the app."
411,"Worthless app. Used to be great, but now it takes me to a captcha and then tells me the page doesn't exist. It then tells me my device is not supported and I should download the app (as though I'm accessing from phone browser, which I am definitely not). If I click to get the app, it takes me to a website for the apple app store ... On an android device (obviously)."
412,"Has repeated problems updating accounts. Goes for WEEKS without being able to update them. You report it, get a useless canned response and nothing. Maybe they should spend less on stupid ads and more on their systems"
413,I never had so much issues with one app ever. The developers have some serious work to do. I have tried linking my accounts and it just keeps telling me to select one option to receive a one time verify me and well it doesn't work. So I'm done trying
414,"Used to be great, now the mobile app doesn't work, asks for captcha and tells me it's checking my browser....but I'm using the app."
415,"*UPDATE 03.29.21 App only shows whole $ amounts *UPDATE 02.03.2020 So after deciding to manually update my most of my accounts because Personal Capital constantly has syncing issues, the one last account I have that was able to automatically sync...stopped. I emailed Personal Capital and informed them. They have escalated the issue. It has been 6 days since the escalation. Still no solution. I want to love Personal Capital, but they have gotten worse since 2018. There's really no excuse for it."
416,Several accounts fail to update even after going thru the steps to verify them. I've sumbitted several support requests but no luck. One request took them a year for them to respond to.
417,very poor acount sync is becoming very difficult as more banks use two step and the app generally cant handle this. Coustomer service is the worse.
418,"Excellent idea but accounts will not remain linked so you have to constantly sign in to each account. Also, will not link all accounts. Spoke to Personal Capital about the issue and they literally did nothing to resolve the issue."
419,"I've had personal capital for years. Loved them at first but as they grew, their features didn't. Their customer service is not good. I've been having issues for month and they're saying they cannot help me so what is reflected in my app isn't real thanks to several glitches. Beware that adding an account could lock you out of your dashboard and that PC doesn't have the power to remove the account that caused the glitch."
420,"The app is stuck on a captcha loop. ""Please complete this additional verification step in order to access Personal Capital"" It's all it shows no matter how many times I solve the captcha. Please fix this problem."
421,"Since March 17th update the app crashes everytime I use it. Half my accounts stopped syncing, my car loan is duplicated, and transactions come through in triplicate for some accounts but balance is right?? Zillow doesn't sync either. I've loved this app so I hope there's another update soon to fix these issues."
422,"Syncing problem everywhere. I moved from Mint to PC becauee Mint did not support Robinhood at that time. But PC is even worse, it fails to sync Webull and even Fidelity, the biggest broker out there. Very disappointing. I tried both on web and app, none of them works Now Mint is back with new UI, and has no syncing problem at all with Robinhood, Webull and Fidelity, so I switch back to Mint. Will wait for a few weeks to see if PC could improve. Otherwise i will delete my account."
423,"First of all, I'd like to say that I love what this app is capable of! It's really helped me see my finances in a whole new way. Seeing my progress really helps me want to save/make more money. Lately the problem seems to be app updates. Most recently I lost the ability to enter fractions of socks into my manual portfolio. I can only enter whole numbers. It seems like they would benefit from having a beta version that could be used to fix the bugs before the main app updates."
424,Wow. This application might be the best example of developers making the application worse with every update. My most recent update wants human verification that redirects to broken links. Can't even access the application.
425,Very nice for fast money management. Well it was until February 2021 now unable to access in app due to poor coding and a secondary security method. When I get in and purge my accounts I am gone.
426,"App used to be good, but now will not update my Capital one account. Also asks me to pick one of three options to update another account, but no matter which one I pick, it keeps asking me to pick one again. Totally useless app now."
427,Can't even create an account. The app says outdated link and takes me to the home page of their website
428,"Used to be great, but now it won't even allow me to add my Checking and Banking accounts. Kind if useless now."
429,Same issue as others. Used to connect to all my accounts. Stopped a few months ago. Useless to me now. Switched to MINT.
430,doesn't update accounts. always a yellow alert icon with no solution.
431,Lately this app will not allow me to log on with password or biometrics on my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. Please help! Formerly 5 stars downgraded to 1 star.
432,Can't even sign up past the mobile phone verification screen. Buttons aren't working.
433,App cannot link to my Voya account. Notified support who told me they were working on it...8 months ago. Still does not connect. App deleted.
434,Not great at actually keeping track of what is in your account. What in saying is the the sync process between this app and your bank/investment/credit card accounts will always need to be re-synced over and over again. I was sync my account every day for 1 whole week. This is inexcusable. If I need to go through the hassle of fixing the account every day my self then not just use an excel spread page and do the work myself. The point of this app is conveniences and this app is in no way this.
435,Doesn't connect to many accounts such as credit unions. Focus seems to be toward pitching their investment services
436,"Junk url for my bank wrong, won't connect"
437,"It's just poor programming at it's core and the ""support"" people offer no actual help, instead giving solutions that had already been told didn't work. You will spend so much time trying to get it to log into each account, repetitively authenticating & re-entering information, only to fail 99% of the time. When it DOES finally log in, it will only work once. Next time you use the app again, you will have to repeat the time-wasting process all over again. I'd advise you not to waste your time."
438,"The app is okay, but after I installed it I was bombarded with calls from their financial advisors trying to sell me their services. So much for privacy and security."
439,Can't log in AT ALL!!
440,"Horrible service. Investment account gets tracked as cash. Ticket has no meaning as it never gets resolved. Don't even think they have any dedicated support team as all i see in response as no eta. It's been 6 month now and all I get is "" I have reviewed the service request for the Ally Bank missing holdings issue in Personal Capital and it has not been resolved at this time. I have been provided with no ETA"""
441,App doesn't work with common andriod devices. Has been down for several months with no fix in sight. Better off using mint.
442,"I can no longer use your app. I use complex 12+ digit random passwords for banking. Since removing the ability to save the password and use a pin to login to the app I can no longer use it. Simplifying my password is not an option, and lastpass free account restrictions makes it no longer viable either. So I have no choice but to say goodbye to Personal Capital."
443,Was good initially but then accounts would not sync. Couldn't even load bank info. Mint synced easier
444,"how convenient. using the app on android for over a year and today when I open the app it says ""you are on a device we dont support."" funny there is the app still on my phone but useless now because somebody decided they dont care about android anymore. thanks for dumping me. I guess I need to dump you back... pretty bad customer service.."
445,Utterly pathetic. Constant and I mean constant connectivity issues to the various financial institutions that take forever to resolve - like months. Half my accounts can't sync up. Issues connecting even to its parent company Empower. Unbelievable.
446,It used too work great now it wont link too my credit union or my Betterment account!! Customer service is worthless!! A great App gone down hill!! Everyone raves about it but yet too me its a waste of time!!
447,Tried to link my bank and got stuck saying choose a second way to verify your account. The drop down menu to text me a code showed me options to choose from but nothing happens when I pressed ok to get to the next step.
448,"One of my banks stopped updating my account balance info. I've contacted customer service several times and no resolution or ETA when they'll get it fixed. Very inconvenient to have my main account unable to update. I feel like my issue is not a priority for them to fix because every time I reach out asking for an update they do not have one, just that they will let me know once it's fixed. I'll be looking for a different app now. Personal Capital sucks!"
449,"After only two days of having an account, Personal Capital kept requiring me to ""fix"" my linked accounts. I have no idea why the link between PC and my accounts kept failing, but it was extremely annoying as I had way too many accounts to be dealing with this after just two days. Additionally, when I would re-link my accounts, it would typically take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes for them to finally link again. I'm sure Personal Capital is a great company, but horrible app."
450,This app has been riddled with problems. It is extremely slow in updating most of my accounts. It gets a number of my accounts wrong on a regular basis. It does not update with many accounts that it's supposed to. And it will not integrate at all with several accounts that I have. Everyday I have a minimum of 3 random accounts not working properly. I have contacted tech support countless times and nothing ever gets resolved. I went to mint and had no problems. Personal capital uninstalled.
451,Its pretty awesome when its working correctly. However it hasn't worked correctly in months. My loans show up as cash in my accounts instead of debt completely throwing off my debt to income ratio making the app essentially useless. I wrote them about the problem in March and have gotten zero updates on their progress or why it isn't done. I even gave suggestions on how to fix (give an option to manually switch from debits to credits) and they have not done anything.
452,So useful and keeps me in the loop about my finances. Switched from Mint and never looking back. Edit: Been having major problems syncing with my ally account recently. It's been since 1/15/2020 and there still hasn't been a solution. If this problem isn't resolved swiftly then personal capital with force my hand to move to another platform. I'm disappointed.
453,"Overall a very cool concept....all of your accounts in one place, easy to monitor your total net worth. However they obviously want to sell you on managing your portfolio. You get a fee ""assessment"" with an ""advisor"". I scheduled and planned for two meetings with an advisor. Both times got a call from someone saying they were running late. If you can't manage your time...how do you plan to manage my finances? Disappointing."
454,"The new updates to the app towards the end of October 2019 suck. The visual style were changed for the worse. The new logo and typeface is fine. But the graphs they totally ruined. Please go back to the the old graphs. Edit: changing this to 1 star because while they did update the graphics and make it better, several accounts no longer link. For example, my main bank, Ally, doesn't link. Hard to use this as a capital and budget tracker if your bank doesn't link to the app."
455,"It could not link 4 of my accounts, not even Vanguard or Sofi. I've deleted my account and uninstalled the app. However, in 1 day I managed to get 2 robo calls from Personal Capital, so they got that part right LOL. What a waste of precious time. I would not recommend this app to any busy professional."
456,This app and website are not good for those looking to have manual control over their budgets. He does not allow you to manually input entries such as daily spending or reconciliation. It has to be done automatically when the app connects to your bank and downloads data. The problem with this is that you have to wait for charges and credits to hit your bank before it'll show up in the app.
457,"The app always crashes at the moment a pop-up appears asking if you want to use fingerprint sign-in, yes or no. All you can do is uninstall and you can get no technical help to fix the issue. I saw the same problem on three different Android phones. Worthless until they find and fix the issue. If they even bother, i guess."
458,"I loved this app. I was a refugee from Mint's degrading account synching support, and Personal Finance did everything Mint did at it's best, and more. But now the app has no option to force update of bank account user credentials. If the app thinks your password changed it will sometimes prompt you to update, but if it doesn't figure out that's the problem then there is no way to fix it. After a certain number of accounts no longer sync, an app like this is worse than useless."
459,"I used to love this app a few months ago and it was my go-to as a single source of truth for all my finanical accounts. However, the last couple of months have resulted in instances of broken accounts for major finanical institutions in the US, which is terrible. Doesn't look like the app is as helpful as it seemed originally which is a shame!"
460,The app looks nice. I'd prefer an opt-out of 2 factor authentication. I uninstalled after a week or so. Beware: They will collect your phone number and call you weekly. They also reach out via email. All of a sudden I am now getting robo calls for low interest loans. 😠 AVOID AT ALL COST.
461,"Having a small issue that I need support with. Would have rated 5 stars, despite issue, but it seems to be impossible to contact support from an Android device. Fix support contact problem and rating will go up. Edit (4/23/20): Everyone I've talked to from this company has been condescending. Edit (5/21/20): Support is useless. Edit (8/30/20): Can now contact support from app, but they don't actually fix any problems. If you haven't given these guys your info, yet, go with Mint instead."
462,"I installed this app to test out as a replacement for another money management app. It didnt have some of the features I wanted, so I decided to delete my account, which was virtually IMPOSSIBLE! To delete your account via the app, one must type ""DELETE"" into a text box that DOESN'T appear. So, I tried via the website; where I also had to type ""DELETE"" in a text box, but the 'Confirm' button did absolutely nothing. Had to email support to finally delete account. Waste of time. Mint is better."
463,"Have used PC for years and it was a great tool for planning, budgeting, and comprehensive overview. In the last couple months it has stopped working with my most significant accounts so it's basically useless. I contacted support twice and was told they'd get right on it and fix it. Still nothing. Very frustrated. I used to recommend this to friends. Not anymore."
464,"While I love the web version, this app fails to load at all on my phone. Several failure reports and an update have gone by without any fix. Now I will have to look for a solution I can actually use on all of my devices. Unfortunate."
465,"This app used to be useful, but now it feels like a waste of time. After entering my PIN, it just sits there and does not proceed, so I have to enter my password to gain entry. After that, only 4 of 11 accounts get updated, many of which have not been properly updated in months. The same accounts get updated with no issue using Mint."
466,"It used to be a great app, but financial institutions have added layers to or changed login addresses. So links to the different accounts are broken. There should be an option to type in the address as well as select from the lists."
467,"TLDR: they seem to just want your information, not interested in a working app. Stopped working after a couple of weeks, won't sync. I've been in contact with technical support but each time they just play the ""it's not our fault, it's theirs"".Truthfully, it's a shame. This could actually be petty useful but I would suggest that anyone who is serious about your finances (and consciously worry about constantly giving away your information to big companies) to just stay away from this product."
468,"Poor customer service. Liabilities were showing as cash (mortgage, cc) . Submitted several tickets for repair. Two months nothing fixed. The company called me several times asking me to sign up for their financial advisory services. I asked them how can I trust them with my money if they fail to fix a simple error on their app. The representatives would tell me they will also submit a trouble ticket. After two months of waiting, DELETE."
469,Most of my linked accounts say theres an issue and they wont update. Ive been in contact with technical support for 5 months and they say there working on it. When the app works its great. But theres to many issues for me and there technical support is no help. Not recomended
470,"Seriously? The install process walks me through a few questions and then I'm told that I've ""earned"" the right to talk to a consultant over the phone. If I wanted to talk on the phone I would have called."
471,"There's been an issue for probably a month now of not being able to get into my ally account. It's also not working with the 2FA from my retirement account. So... The app is about to be uninstalled. What a shame, used to be just what I needed"
472,"Don't like the new colors. But worse, you've significantly reduced the height of the graphs by duplicating the current value for the section. Completely unnecessary! Furthermore, the green text that is supposedly the change over a date range is just flat out wrong."
473,"I submitted a ticket for incorrect categorization of accounts weeks ago and have received no estimated time of correction. When I emailed, asking for an update, all I received was a very rude, snarky response about not updating me until the issue was resolved, once again with no time line."
474,"Requires me to renter the answers to my security questions for each account everytime I refresh. The budget functionality is very limited, can't set category level budget. No splitting transactions. Very good at getting a birds eye view of financial situation."
475,"Used to be much better, but works with fewer of my accts now and recently just became non-functional with my bank because it wont allow me to select an authentication method. Waited a couple months for a fix, but it's definitely gone down hill."
476,"I used to like this app. It used to work. Now, it can't connect to my largest account at all. For 2 others, it requires care and feeding, constantly entering passwords, passcodes that rarely result in a connection. Only two of my accounts work: Fidelity and Robinhood. This is pretty pathetic."
477,"Had it at 5 stars, but downgraded it to 1 since the new update added a verification step that freezes the app upon trying to login. While the Google Captcha might work on desktops, it will NOT work with the app. Thus 1 star for rendering the app completely inoperable until it is fixed."
478,"Used to love, has dropped in quality and functionality. All of my Ally bank accounts and my betterment accounts don't work or connect with personal capital anymore. They told me 6 months ago they are trying to fix this problem and have still not."
479,"Stopped syncing with chase weeks ago and the ""Fix account"" option doesn't do anything at all. Completely useless now."
480,No more fractional shares in the new update causing my tracked net worth to drop $50k overnight. What's the point of using this app if you can't even track your holdings?
481,"App usually says ""problems connecting to the internet"" and refuses to let me sign on. My internet connection is fine. But the app is useless because it won't connect."
482,Similar complaint as other recent reviews. Keeps telling me the accounts I've linked require additional security clearance but there is no way to provide that additional clearance. Once this gets fixed I'm hoping I can leave a more positive review.
483,"There's no way to refresh transactions manually. There's also no way to remove their (huge) list of default transactions, and there's no way to automatically categorize into the correct category. Equally as terrible as Mint."
484,"The app is not connecting my accounts and for the couple that do connect, they've disconnected after some time. No customer service informational easily available to help. This app has declined in quality over time."
485,"Has significant problems mapping to well established banking institutions such as Chase, Wells Fargo, Capital One, etc. Reported issues, told several times that engineers fixed, rarely do supposed fixes work, and it's been 6 months in some cases without resolution. Personal Capital needs to fix itself."
486,"I've used this for two years. It's tracked all my accounts successfully for two out of 24 months. It rarely understand debts, loans, or transfers and gives you no way to correct errors yourself."
487,As a QA engineer I am surprised how many problems I came across with using the app for 15 minutes. Not sure how it has the rating it does. I requested my account to be deleted and will stick with other applications. Hope they can improve their QA.
488,"Does not update accounts. The few that do update are refreshed on a monthly basis. Opening the app I am met with red exclamation points and every attempt to ""fix account"" results in failure."
489,"Personal Capital isn't syncing with Ally Bank... Super annoyed. Other than that, I love this tool, it's amazing. They just need to fix their constant syncing issues."
490,"Installed, wouldn't let me enter random categories, would open the text/number pop up then immediately close it not allowing me to enter anything in. Happens repeatedly for certain categories making the app completely unusable. I use an android, galaxy S9"
491,"Have to ""fix"" most accounts every time I log in and the accounts I dont have to fix wont update. Couldbt get all of my accounts to even link with this app to be viewable so not worth it for me since accounts either dont update, wont connect or have to be fixed everytime I log in."
492,"only wanted get the advertised retirement planer as seen in american airlines mag. didnot, and do not want to add all kinds of personal information and lonk to money accounts and have to schedule a free 30 minute session with a finacial planner just to get to the ""free"" planner. feels like ""bait and switch to me"" not impressed."
493,Do not use if you have an HSA or Multiple Credit Union Accounts. They constantly break and this company take over 90 days to fix anything. Extremely frustrating to work with. Just use mint
494,Several of my accounts show incorrect balances or have stopped updating. The developers have no response on when or if it will get fixed. I no longer trust any of the numbers reported through the app.
495,capital one bank account never managed to sink. initially it seemed fine but lately it hasn't synced at all. Kept asking me for my last digit of the phone number yet did nothing.
496,"decent cash flow analysis, but it's really just a platform for agents looking to sell investments. I turned OFF all notifications, but I still received emails and even a phone call from them. I deleted the app."
497,Just deleted from my phone. Hasn't let me log in this last week. Accounts keep disconnecting.
498,"This was my #1 financial app, to see all accounts at a glance. The recent changes has made it completely unusable. Such a disaster! Just roll back to the previous stable version guys!"
499,"Application was great a while ago. However, these days it's unreliable. Linking one of my account is always failing and Personal failed to address this even after multiple requests."
500,Won't let me open it...
501,"Join with caution. Personal Capital has been unable to connect to Zillow like they once did. Known issue that they haven't fixed for 6 months. A home is often ones largest investment. If they cant care for that, they'll never achieve their goal of managing our investment portfolio. Also, they frequently have problems connecting to our financial institutions to update our activity - so accuracy of data is always in question."
502,push notification ads :(
503,"Won't connect to many services consistently - even more when 2FA is enabled. Clearly thats not their fault, but doesn't speak too highly for the app's future. Used to be a perfect service but so much has changed over the years. Update: Uninstalled in favor of no alternative. Not worth it."
504,Not great at actually keeping track of what is in your account. What in saying is the the sync process between this app and your bank/investment/credit card accounts will always need to be re-synced over and over again. I was sync my account every day for 1 whole week. This is inexcusable. If I need to go through the hassle of fixing the account every day my self then not just use an excel spread page and do the work myself. The point of this app is conveniences and this app is in no way this.
505,Widgets often need to be removed and replaced in order to work properly. . . . . . . Wish the app had all the functions that the site does. June 21 update.... Recent changes lower review from 3 stars to one. Crashes constantly.
506,Can't even login to use the app... See: every other 1 star rating. Such a bummer.
507,"The app is okay, but after I installed it I was bombarded with calls from their financial advisors trying to sell me their services. So much for privacy and security."
508,very poor acount sync is becoming very difficult as more banks use two step and the app generally cant handle this. Coustomer service is the worse.
509,App doesn't work with common andriod devices. Has been down for several months with no fix in sight. Better off using mint.
510,Needs work. I had to keep logging in for capital one and wells Fargo. Then I forgot my password for personal and resetting itself is a project. It took 15 attempts thru personal just to reset my password.
511,Difficult to get going
512,doesn't update accounts. always a yellow alert icon with no solution.
513,Several accounts fail to update even after going thru the steps to verify them. I've sumbitted several support requests but no luck. One request took them a year for them to respond to.
514,"App only work on some android devices. If you are unlucky, you will get stuck on a page stating ""Please complete this additional verification step in order to access Personal Capital Please stand by, while we are checking your browser..."""
515,"Used to be great, now the mobile app doesn't work, asks for captcha and tells me it's checking my browser....but I'm using the app."
516,"Been a user for years, suddenly cannot login to mobile app. It sends me to a new captcha check, then when I finish, it sends me to an error page saying the page doesn't exist. It then prompts me to download the mobile app, but is recommending the apple app store download even though I have a samsung android phone. Total fail here on the update guys. Can't even access my data on mobile anymore, where is your QA department in all this? Please get rid of the captcha check until fixed!"
517,"I have used This app for over 2 years now and find it unreliable and a complete waste of my time. 4 months now accounts fail to update. I keep submitting requests on the issue. a few weeks go by and they close the request saying it is solved when infact it is not. This app is a complete waist of my time. Quicken, here I come."
518,For us only. Trash
519,"One year later, still offers a complete lack of connectivity to banks it says it supports, and has not resolved these issues despite numerous reports. Other apps do not have these issue with the same banks. Perpetually unresolved."
520,"Has repeated problems updating accounts. Goes for WEEKS without being able to update them. You report it, get a useless canned response and nothing. Maybe they should spend less on stupid ads and more on their systems"
521,Was good initially but then accounts would not sync. Couldn't even load bank info. Mint synced easier
522,"Overall I love this app. It provides a lot of detail for all of my accounts I link up. It has helped keep me in touch with my finances. And offered advice on my investments. But the reason for the 1 stars instead of 5 rating is because every time I log in, (no joke - every time...) I have to re-sync my Capital One accounts. Code and all. It makes me not want to use this app, honestly. Please fix this! I uninstalled this app for the reasons above. Nothing kept linked. Too much work."
523,Can't even create an account. The app says outdated link and takes me to the home page of their website
524,Junk
525,Can't get rid of it
526,Pain in the A....
527,Can't get most accounts to sync
528,Lately this app will not allow me to log on with password or biometrics on my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. Please help! Formerly 5 stars downgraded to 1 star.
529,"Used to be great, but now it won't even allow me to add my Checking and Banking accounts. Kind if useless now."
530,Doesn't work on a Galaxy S10?
531,"First of all, I'd like to say that I love what this app is capable of! It's really helped me see my finances in a whole new way. Seeing my progress really helps me want to save/make more money. Lately the problem seems to be app updates. Most recently I lost the ability to enter fractions of socks into my manual portfolio. I can only enter whole numbers. It seems like they would benefit from having a beta version that could be used to fix the bugs before the main app updates."
532,Can't log in AT ALL!!
533,"Junk url for my bank wrong, won't connect"
534,"*UPDATE 03.29.21 App only shows whole $ amounts *UPDATE 02.03.2020 So after deciding to manually update my most of my accounts because Personal Capital constantly has syncing issues, the one last account I have that was able to automatically sync...stopped. I emailed Personal Capital and informed them. They have escalated the issue. It has been 6 days since the escalation. Still no solution. I want to love Personal Capital, but they have gotten worse since 2018. There's really no excuse for it."
535,Just deleted from my phone. Hasn't let me log in this last week. Accounts keep disconnecting.
536,Same issue as others. Used to connect to all my accounts. Stopped a few months ago. Useless to me now. Switched to MINT.
537,Doesn't connect to many accounts such as credit unions. Focus seems to be toward pitching their investment services
538,"Syncing problem everywhere. I moved from Mint to PC becauee Mint did not support Robinhood at that time. But PC is even worse, it fails to sync Webull and even Fidelity, the biggest broker out there. Very disappointing. I tried both on web and app, none of them works Now Mint is back with new UI, and has no syncing problem at all with Robinhood, Webull and Fidelity, so I switch back to Mint. Will wait for a few weeks to see if PC could improve. Otherwise i will delete my account."
539,"I've had personal capital for years. Loved them at first but as they grew, their features didn't. Their customer service is not good. I've been having issues for month and they're saying they cannot help me so what is reflected in my app isn't real thanks to several glitches. Beware that adding an account could lock you out of your dashboard and that PC doesn't have the power to remove the account that caused the glitch."
540,Nothing is working
541,Wow. This application might be the best example of developers making the application worse with every update. My most recent update wants human verification that redirects to broken links. Can't even access the application.
542,"Since March 17th update the app crashes everytime I use it. Half my accounts stopped syncing, my car loan is duplicated, and transactions come through in triplicate for some accounts but balance is right?? Zillow doesn't sync either. I've loved this app so I hope there's another update soon to fix these issues."
543,No more fractional shares in the new update causing my tracked net worth to drop $50k overnight. What's the point of using this app if you can't even track your holdings?
544,It should've believed all the recent reviews. Highly dysfunctional
545,Tried to link my bank and got stuck saying choose a second way to verify your account. The drop down menu to text me a code showed me options to choose from but nothing happens when I pressed ok to get to the next step.
546,"Worthless app. Used to be great, but now it takes me to a captcha and then tells me the page doesn't exist. It then tells me my device is not supported and I should download the app (as though I'm accessing from phone browser, which I am definitely not). If I click to get the app, it takes me to a website for the apple app store ... On an android device (obviously)."
547,"App used to be good, but now will not update my Capital one account. Also asks me to pick one of three options to update another account, but no matter which one I pick, it keeps asking me to pick one again. Totally useless app now."
548,Very nice for fast money management. Well it was until February 2021 now unable to access in app due to poor coding and a secondary security method. When I get in and purge my accounts I am gone.
549,"I rated this with only 1 star because although the functionality is there, I was only able to add some of my accounts. I suppose it has something to do with getting hungup on security (which I like) but there is no way to finally enter the additional security info. There is a link for but it doesn't do anything. So I am still left without a complete summary of my personal capital which was the whole purpose for me to download the app."
550,Can't even sign up past the mobile phone verification screen. Buttons aren't working.
551,Ccu one time code does not work
552,"Horrible service. Investment account gets tracked as cash. Ticket has no meaning as it never gets resolved. Don't even think they have any dedicated support team as all i see in response as no eta. It's been 6 month now and all I get is "" I have reviewed the service request for the Ally Bank missing holdings issue in Personal Capital and it has not been resolved at this time. I have been provided with no ETA"""
553,Great until they spam call you offering their services. Not interested. Stop calling!
554,"I can no longer use your app. I use complex 12+ digit random passwords for banking. Since removing the ability to save the password and use a pin to login to the app I can no longer use it. Simplifying my password is not an option, and lastpass free account restrictions makes it no longer viable either. So I have no choice but to say goodbye to Personal Capital."
555,"They say you can use the financial tools and then you got to have the app in order to have the app you have to link your accounts and they only do portfolios over $100,000 I mean it's just crazy stupid scamming lying deceiving advertisement thank you very much"
556,"Used to be great and helped me become debt free. But lately I keep getting a captcha to log in but then it either takes me to a page that doesn't exist or tells me my device isn't supported. Then it'll work like normal for a day or two, then I'll get the captcha thing again and it's useless for a day or two. Frustrating. Fix it. (Update: I've decreased my rating further because it is still happening constantly. Makes the app unusable.)"
557,I never had so much issues with one app ever. The developers have some serious work to do. I have tried linking my accounts and it just keeps telling me to select one option to receive a one time verify me and well it doesn't work. So I'm done trying
558,"App sent me a random notification asking me to refer people, in my book any notification I did not ask for that is an ad is not acceptable. Uninstalled"
559,"Excellent idea but accounts will not remain linked so you have to constantly sign in to each account. Also, will not link all accounts. Spoke to Personal Capital about the issue and they literally did nothing to resolve the issue."
560,Don't use if you value your information. My spam calls for financial sevices has tripled.
561,"The app is stuck on a captcha loop. ""Please complete this additional verification step in order to access Personal Capital"" It's all it shows no matter how many times I solve the captcha. Please fix this problem."
562,App cannot link to my Voya account. Notified support who told me they were working on it...8 months ago. Still does not connect. App deleted.
563,Won't sync with my bank so app is pointless
564,Just doesn't work...
565,It used too work great now it wont link too my credit union or my Betterment account!! Customer service is worthless!! A great App gone down hill!! Everyone raves about it but yet too me its a waste of time!!
566,"So now none of my other credentials work for the app. My bank won't ever load, my investment portfolio works once a week, and the credit card won't track. Just useless now."
567,Utterly pathetic. Constant and I mean constant connectivity issues to the various financial institutions that take forever to resolve - like months. Half my accounts can't sync up. Issues connecting even to its parent company Empower. Unbelievable.
568,"It could not link 4 of my accounts, not even Vanguard or Sofi. I've deleted my account and uninstalled the app. However, in 1 day I managed to get 2 robo calls from Personal Capital, so they got that part right LOL. What a waste of precious time. I would not recommend this app to any busy professional."
569,"Seriously? The install process walks me through a few questions and then I'm told that I've ""earned"" the right to talk to a consultant over the phone. If I wanted to talk on the phone I would have called."
570,"I signed up but wrote my phone number incorrectly. Can't change it, as after logging it it goes directly towards verification"
571,"It's just poor programming at it's core and the ""support"" people offer no actual help, instead giving solutions that had already been told didn't work. You will spend so much time trying to get it to log into each account, repetitively authenticating & re-entering information, only to fail 99% of the time. When it DOES finally log in, it will only work once. Next time you use the app again, you will have to repeat the time-wasting process all over again. I'd advise you not to waste your time."
572,The application is unstable as a financial solution. Do not trust with vital user details.
573,After making a new account I am unable to link either my Navient or Credit Karma accounts.
574,This app doesn't link all my accounts so it's worthless to me.
575,"how convenient. using the app on android for over a year and today when I open the app it says ""you are on a device we dont support."" funny there is the app still on my phone but useless now because somebody decided they dont care about android anymore. thanks for dumping me. I guess I need to dump you back... pretty bad customer service.."
576,What a stupid way to enable 2FAC!
577,"Stopped syncing with chase weeks ago and the ""Fix account"" option doesn't do anything at all. Completely useless now."
578,They harass you at least once a month with phone calls. And now my bofa account considers its queries a security threat and locks my account everytime I open this app. Unacceptable.
579,Zero customer service. All you get is a bot to chat with. No responses to my several emails. I was contacting PC because my data was off by a long shot. I'm closing my account with them.
580,App seems to have broken. Won't let me log in saying this device isn't supported.
581,"Unable to access the app as I get an error message: ""Looks like you're on a device that we don't support"". But I'm on a Google Pixel 4 XL with the latest Android system"
582,"This app was awesome for years, but since October my accounts won't update. The help desk says there is no timeline on a patch. This app now boarders on useless."
583,"Had it at 5 stars, but downgraded it to 1 since the new update added a verification step that freezes the app upon trying to login. While the Google Captcha might work on desktops, it will NOT work with the app. Thus 1 star for rendering the app completely inoperable until it is fixed."
584,Used to work fine. Now it won't open and stays stuck in a verification loop through the web browser inside the app... Then says it's not supported on this device.
585,Stuck. Caught in some terrible verification loop where I can only verify that I'm human it takes me to a page where it says my browser isn't supported (I'm not using a browser I'm using the app) and it wants me to download the app (from with the app that I installed)
586,App recently broke for me. Requires additional verification step but then gets stuck.
587,The app seems to have been hacked. It's not safe
588,"After an attempted forced sales call (which I cancelled but they called anyway), an accidental duplicate account (which I had to get rid of with some creative accounting), and a botched account read which is making my net worth appear to be 10x what it is, I'm not feeling terribly confident about this company. Hoping relations will improve with them after sending two tech support requests. Will update. Straight up does not seem to work with Interactive Brokers which makes this useless to me."
589,Called my phone number after I made an account. Wouldn't trust this company to keep my data private
590,"Terrible This doesn't allow to reactivate an investment account. App was doubling investment account, closed one of three, and now can't communicate with the other. Get busy people and make this app more user friendly."
591,"I loved this app. I was a refugee from Mint's degrading account synching support, and Personal Finance did everything Mint did at it's best, and more. But now the app has no option to force update of bank account user credentials. If the app thinks your password changed it will sometimes prompt you to update, but if it doesn't figure out that's the problem then there is no way to fix it. After a certain number of accounts no longer sync, an app like this is worse than useless."
592,"The app is not connecting my accounts and for the couple that do connect, they've disconnected after some time. No customer service informational easily available to help. This app has declined in quality over time."
593,Most banking systems allow communication through third-party-access API. There is NO reason to require password and 2FA passcode anymore.
594,Lacks fundamental and important functionality that has been present in the iOS version for TWO YEARS. Several contacts to support revealed they don't care and have no plans to address this. Personal Capital is prejudiced against Android users. I suggest taking your financial business elsewhere.
595,It supports only US phones. Therefore I cannot even join..
596,Can't login anymore in samsung galaxy 10. App now says my device is not supported.
597,"This was my #1 financial app, to see all accounts at a glance. The recent changes has made it completely unusable. Such a disaster! Just roll back to the previous stable version guys!"
598,This app is the worst. Don't waste your time downloading it never works.
599,"I used to love this app a few months ago and it was my go-to as a single source of truth for all my finanical accounts. However, the last couple of months have resulted in instances of broken accounts for major finanical institutions in the US, which is terrible. Doesn't look like the app is as helpful as it seemed originally which is a shame!"
600,"The idea is great, the app is just so dang laggy and slow. The swipes and taps are almost unusable. They need to rewrite it natively. Also, most modern apps have dark mode this app does not. Lastly, I ran into an extremely frustrating bug where it recategorized every single transaction to 'entertainment'. It's too much work to go fix it all. I had a lot. My hopes are that one day, this app becomes great, cause I like the theory and thought they have going here."
601,"Can't connect. My bank is not available, so I want to either use this with my bank or cancel. Its not letting me connect my bank or cancel. I will be very upset if I get charged for nothing."
602,"I really want to like this app and service. Some of the advanced features sold me on it and the feature roadmap seemed promising. So far I've been able to excuse the minor bugs with features like goals not updating on some platforms, or when the algorithm matches account payments incorrectly, or the seemingly random ability to link transactions that sometimes inexplicably fails, or even when transaction payee is inexplicably renamed to something unrelated and I have to dig around to find out what the transaction actually was. I can live with these issues and hope they'll work out the kinks. But my most recent problem with this service was incredibly frustrating that has made me reconsider their service. I went to login today and was prompted to select a plan. When I checked my subscription in Google play it was set to renew today and there was no sign of an issue. I reached out to support and they were unable to help me suggesting that I wait 24-48 hours for the payment to process. I am currently unable to access the account that I have paid for.."
603,This continues to be one of the worst financial apps I've ever used. CONSTANTLY disconnects from my accounts! I just cancelled my yearly rebill and will ask for a refund of remaining months
604,"I cannot use Simplifi because it forces one to pay through the Google Play store right off the bat. I would please like to use the 30 day free trial to see if all my accounts can even link to Simplifi. Then I would be more then happy to pay via my debit card or checking account, but one cannot do that in Simplifi. One must purchase via the Google Play store first to even see the insides of the application."
605,"Was the best finance app available, until it randomly wouldnt let me connect to my usaa account (cscrape.102 error) after I had been using it for 4 months. Support basically said sorry usaa is blocking your connection, usaa said that they don't have support for simplifi, and of course it was past the 30 day window so I paid for a year and now I can't use it and they won't give a refund."
606,"This service should be free, especially since it doesn't work as well as advertised. Having to input all the information that's supposed to be automated makes this app as bad as Mint...which is free. I'll stick to free apps that work, even if they don't have all the bells and whistles."
607,It is not user friendly at all!! I don't understand how to even set up monthly expenses and create a budget using this
608,Does not connect to Citi or American Express Savings. Not going to pay premium dollars for an app that can't deliver
609,"App is sooo slow. Used it because this was the only app that could connect all my accounts, since then other apps have improved. Also, could never get the savings goal feature to work properly."
610,The app and customer service are a joke. I've emailed them 3 times and can't seem to get a response. It isn't compatible with my bank and it wouldn't let me cancel before the trial period ended. Now I'm trying to get my money back but again can't seem to get anyone to reach out. Stay away from this and go to pocket guard or something similar.
611,HELP!!! I tried to create an account. My email and credit card info are in there. It errored during phone number and password creation. The only forgot password option is through my phone number. I either need my number added or the account deleted so I can try again.
612,Stuck on creating my finances for over an hour. Removed my Google subscription. Would have expected a better app
613,Have to create an account not even sure if it's for the proper use of ordering commissary for an inmate. Linked to San Diego sheriff dept. Online. Not satisfied with app. Dont even deserve one star.
614,Terrible experience with the app used it for 1 month and paid for it no complaint but then the next year rolls around and google decides to charge my card again for a app I used for 1 month and will not give me a refund I have other apps I use with Google I just want my money back wish I could give negative feedback.
615,"Update... still a 1 star, but they do seem to fix things quickly... This product is not really market ready. You should consider it pre-production, and if you use it, you are a beta tester for Quicken. There are so many bugs that I've lost count. When you report them, the response is always the say ""great point, we'll send that to the developers"". If you plan to rely on this product, wait another 6 months. If you like testing new software that is Rev -1, you will love Simplifi."
616,Hmm. I don't know. Its been 3 days and its not down loading my Transactions.
617,Can only use if you subscribe
618,"I was was willing to test out the app until you wanted my credit card before proving your worth my time/money. Sorry, not going to happen"
619,"Missing key feature. Like every other budgeting tool out there, this lacks the ability to see day-to-day cash flow. Sure, I make $X this month, and plan to spend $Y dollars, with Y less that X. But if half the income isn't coming in until the last week of the month, and all the expenses are due in the first week, I'm going to have a shortfall, no matter what a monthly budget tells me. This has all kinds of ways to view your income and expenses, but not that basic, number one most important"
620,"The app is excellent at one thing, and one thing only. ACCURATE automatic tracking of past historical finances. Alot of apps that do automatic categories for spent money, do it badly. It can feel like you are correcting everything. This app does this VERY well. But that's it. It doesn't have a Bill calendar. It doesn't allow you to see your cashflow down to the day. And most importantly, the bank balances are not accurate all the time. $3.99 per mth is too much JUST for auto tracking."
621,"Good ideas and all. Either the programmers don't know how to implement them, or the folks with the ideas don't know how to communicate them. In the end, very little of it actually works. My wife and I can't log in at the same time. When we do, we don't see each others updates. Also, any settings, including assigning categories to a transaction, made on any device besides my wife's laptop seem to only happen locally and don't update the cloud. Plus too many more broken features to list here."
622,"Changed Categories For All My Transactions! I like Simplifi on the website. But yesterday I used this Android mobile application to change the category of a new transaction from Uncategorized to Groceries. After I did that, every transaction on all of my accounts including checking, savings, and credit card was set to Groceries. I spent several hours last night fixing it. I went all the way back to January and then went to bed. I will be uninstalling this app and only using the website."
623,"Poor reconciliation. I have transactions that I will post as soon as I make them. (e.g. purchasing coffee, etc.) A few days go by and see the transaction posted by the bank in the app. Then, I look and see that what I have posted and still there as pending. Sometimes, something doesn't grab from bank, no problem, I just reconcile the payment myself, but can't, no function to do so. Sometimes the bank would have cleared a transaction and app would take days to pull this data for it to clear."
624,"They require you to link to an email that ""already exists"". You can't enter email information manually. ""Trying"" means giving them your credit card number. Without even seeing if the app is worthwhile, I don't think asking for credit card information is something I'd do. Let me enter an email address manually."
625,"Revising my earlier rating. I tried the process again after waiting a while. I chose my email, instead of a number, to received the 2FA message to. It STILL sent the message to the wrong phone number, just like earlier. And the support part of the app is broken. Terrible so far."
626,"I have to pay..???? I already pay for quicken, why the heck would I want to pay for YOUR app extension. A monthly subscription model at that. If you have to charge a monthly subscription for an app that is supposed to help you manage your money your marketing strategy is way off. Make the App Free Sync your different experiences. Your foundational application and mobile app dont share anything in common. Bottom line...ya biffed it of this one....uninstalling now..."
627,If you are looking for a financial app that will NOT display your correct balance and tech support that CANNOT solve that simple problem then this app is for you. After trying for nearly two months and after numerous emails and even a conference call with a developer they could not get my checking account to display the correct balance. It's a shame as I really liked some aspects of this app. Other apps have similar features and display correct account balances. Some are even free like Mint.
628,"I don't know to report an issue. The main function of the app is to connect to your bank to take the manual input out of the equation, but my bank which is listed on many other apps and fdic backed with an online webpage isn't listed so this app is virtually useless to me so I am unsubscribing and deleting the app, I had high hopes for it."
629,Will not download my credit card from the same bank that I have checking and savings in. Without that I cannot balance a budget or two my money.
630,Too complicated and one of my loans was checked on too often. I got text notices 3-4 times a day about my temp log in for the account. I want something easier to navigate and understand. (I worked in accounting for years)
631,"This app doubles many of the transactions, making the dashboard a complete nightmare. No easy way to mark duplicates. It's much worse at everything than Mint."
632,"In typical Quicken fasion, this thing is junk right out of the box - I was unable to log in with my valid Quicken ID. I it's valid case I can log in ths Quicken web site but not this dumb app - was this developed by the same dummys that did the Quicken Mobile app cause that is junk as well - ugh"
633,Worked great until the past month when it got buggy. Uninstalled.
634,"Can not add my bank. It logs in initially, but once set up, keeps saying these accounts need fixed!! I tried about 8 times no luck. Un installing."
635,Really disappointed. App displays duplicate transactions. No since in paying for a service that is inaccurate.
636,It's hard making the perfect app but we in general are much further and better off than what this app fails at. I use another app now and it does all that this app professed it would.
637,"Was scammed. Charged for Free trial. Contacted customer service on the day the free trial ended, was told no refunds. Reporting to BBB. App did not even work. Awful product and even worse customer support"
638,It is apparently impossible to login with the app when the website works fine.
639,"Charging for an app that is basically In beta? Ummm.... No. Mint is free, better reporting and can remember transaction categories."
640,Took my information and then tried to charge my account automatically once I created the account. Had my access to my google account without my consent...pure fraud !! Do not download
641,"This app. was put together so sloppy & very, very not user friendly. I highly recommend this app is a joke!!!!"
642,Too many bugs while trying this out. The app AND website need a lot of work.
643,Signed in with my quicken ID and it said finish setting up simplifi and then only had a logout button
644,Worst tracking app ever. Total fail by quicken. Don't waste your money.
645,Slow and buggy app. Not worth your time.
646,Charged me when I didn't sign up for anything.
647,My standard banking app has more features than this. Pricing from $36-$61!
648,Cannot mark upcoming bills as paid! How annoying!
649,App is glitchy...great web interface
650,Tried it and it's terrible so glad for 30 day trials.
651,"Starting from scratch again? I've been a quicken user for years and now you want me to start over and input everything again, even though I'm using my quicken online Id that has all my financial info already? No thanks."
652,Great idea but wouldn't sync accounts.
653,I already have this information they quicken. App is redundant
654,This is a good example of why we need a block option for bad devs on Google play
655,Downloaded and installed a app that does not work. Freezes.
656,"Im sorry im not paying for an app like this when i can get so many other cards like western union, direct deposit tye money and get the app for free."
657,Can't link any account and it won't let you move forward until you do.
658,Paying for the same thing as 100 apps...
659,Unbelievable that nothing transferred
660,I canceled this and still got charged for it
661,Didn't get far since it couldn't link the first account I tried to add - Merrill edge.
662,"Garbage!!!... Here's another money saving, financial app THAT COSTS MONEY! STRAIGHT GARBAGE!"
663,You have to pay per month to use this app... disappointing
664,Spend money to save money? No thank you.
665,It doesn't work
666,Can't sign up to use it
667,I dont need this app and am trying to get it off my phoneplease help get this app off my phone
668,Better pay scheme than Albert I'll give them that. But short on features. Run at startup
669,I no can uninstall this appr.
670,Need a bank to use it.
671,I ain't paying for this.
672,Don't know anything about it
673,I havent had this app for to long
674,Hi I'm ganya I did enter my app
675,My bank accounts are none of your flipping business
676,Have to pay $39.99
677,Dont know it
678,Run at startup?
679,Downloaded the wrong app.
680,Not FREE App
681,Sucks
682,Useless
683,K(
684,Can only use if you subscribe

686,"App is sooo slow. Used it because this was the only app that could connect all my accounts, since then other apps have improved. Also, could never get the savings goal feature to work properly."

If you like testing new software that is Rev -1, you will love Simplifi."
717,It's hard making the perfect app but we in general are much further and better off than what this app fails at. I use another app now and it does all that this app professed it would.
718,"Good ideas and all. Either the programmers don't know how to implement them, or the folks with the ideas don't know how to communicate them. In the end, very little of it actually works. My wife and I can't log in at the same time. When we do, we don't see each others updates. Also, any settings, including assigning categories to a transaction, made on any device besides my wife's laptop seem to only happen locally and don't update the cloud. Plus too many more broken features to list here."
719,Can't sign up to use it
720,Great idea but wouldn't sync accounts.
721,My standard banking app has more features than this. Pricing from $36-$61!
722,Too many bugs while trying this out. The app AND website need a lot of work.
723,"Can not add my bank. It logs in initially, but once set up, keeps saying these accounts need fixed!! I tried about 8 times no luck. Un installing."
724,"Was scammed. Charged for Free trial. Contacted customer service on the day the free trial ended, was told no refunds. Reporting to BBB. App did not even work. Awful product and even worse customer support"
725,Have to pay $39.99
726,"They require you to link to an email that ""already exists"". You can't enter email information manually. ""Trying"" means giving them your credit card number. Without even seeing if the app is worthwhile, I don't think asking for credit card information is something I'd do. Let me enter an email address manually."
727,"I don't know to report an issue. The main function of the app is to connect to your bank to take the manual input out of the equation, but my bank which is listed on many other apps and fdic backed with an online webpage isn't listed so this app is virtually useless to me so I am unsubscribing and deleting the app, I had high hopes for it."
728,Too complicated and one of my loans was checked on too often. I got text notices 3-4 times a day about my temp log in for the account. I want something easier to navigate and understand. (I worked in accounting for years)
729,Useless
730,Run at startup?
731,I no can uninstall this appr.
732,It is apparently impossible to login with the app when the website works fine.
733,Better pay scheme than Albert I'll give them that. But short on features. Run at startup
734,Downloaded the wrong app.
735,"This app. was put together so sloppy & very, very not user friendly. I highly recommend this app is a joke!!!!"
736,"Missing key feature. Like every other budgeting tool out there, this lacks the ability to see day-to-day cash flow. Sure, I make $X this month, and plan to spend $Y dollars, with Y less that X. But if half the income isn't coming in until the last week of the month, and all the expenses are due in the first week, I'm going to have a shortfall, no matter what a monthly budget tells me. This has all kinds of ways to view your income and expenses, but not that basic, number one most important"
737,Can't link any account and it won't let you move forward until you do.
738,Worst tracking app ever. Total fail by quicken. Don't waste your money.
739,I canceled this and still got charged for it
740,I dont need this app and am trying to get it off my phoneplease help get this app off my phone
741,"Im sorry im not paying for an app like this when i can get so many other cards like western union, direct deposit tye money and get the app for free."
742,Hi I'm ganya I did enter my app
743,I havent had this app for to long
744,"Charging for an app that is basically In beta? Ummm.... No. Mint is free, better reporting and can remember transaction categories."
745,"The app is excellent at one thing, and one thing only. ACCURATE automatic tracking of past historical finances. Alot of apps that do automatic categories for spent money, do it badly. It can feel like you are correcting everything. This app does this VERY well. But that's it. It doesn't have a Bill calendar. It doesn't allow you to see your cashflow down to the day. And most importantly, the bank balances are not accurate all the time. $3.99 per mth is too much JUST for auto tracking."
746,I ain't paying for this.
747,Took my information and then tried to charge my account automatically once I created the account. Had my access to my google account without my consent...pure fraud !! Do not download
748,My bank accounts are none of your flipping business
749,Downloaded and installed a app that does not work. Freezes.
750,K(
751,If you are looking for a financial app that will NOT display your correct balance and tech support that CANNOT solve that simple problem then this app is for you. After trying for nearly two months and after numerous emails and even a conference call with a developer they could not get my checking account to display the correct balance. It's a shame as I really liked some aspects of this app. Other apps have similar features and display correct account balances. Some are even free like Mint.
752,"Changed Categories For All My Transactions! I like Simplifi on the website. But yesterday I used this Android mobile application to change the category of a new transaction from Uncategorized to Groceries. After I did that, every transaction on all of my accounts including checking, savings, and credit card was set to Groceries. I spent several hours last night fixing it. I went all the way back to January and then went to bed. I will be uninstalling this app and only using the website."
753,This is a good example of why we need a block option for bad devs on Google play
754,Didn't get far since it couldn't link the first account I tried to add - Merrill edge.
755,App is glitchy...great web interface
756,Spend money to save money? No thank you.
757,"This app doubles many of the transactions, making the dashboard a complete nightmare. No easy way to mark duplicates. It's much worse at everything than Mint."
758,Really disappointed. App displays duplicate transactions. No since in paying for a service that is inaccurate.
759,"Garbage!!!... Here's another money saving, financial app THAT COSTS MONEY! STRAIGHT GARBAGE!"
760,"I have to pay..???? I already pay for quicken, why the heck would I want to pay for YOUR app extension. A monthly subscription model at that. If you have to charge a monthly subscription for an app that is supposed to help you manage your money your marketing strategy is way off. Make the App Free Sync your different experiences. Your foundational application and mobile app dont share anything in common. Bottom line...ya biffed it of this one....uninstalling now..."
761,Unbelievable that nothing transferred
762,"Poor reconciliation. I have transactions that I will post as soon as I make them. (e.g. purchasing coffee, etc.) A few days go by and see the transaction posted by the bank in the app. Then, I look and see that what I have posted and still there as pending. Sometimes, something doesn't grab from bank, no problem, I just reconcile the payment myself, but can't, no function to do so. Sometimes the bank would have cleared a transaction and app would take days to pull this data for it to clear."
763,Not FREE App
764,"Revising my earlier rating. I tried the process again after waiting a while. I chose my email, instead of a number, to received the 2FA message to. It STILL sent the message to the wrong phone number, just like earlier. And the support part of the app is broken. Terrible so far."
765,"Starting from scratch again? I've been a quicken user for years and now you want me to start over and input everything again, even though I'm using my quicken online Id that has all my financial info already? No thanks."
766,Signed in with my quicken ID and it said finish setting up simplifi and then only had a logout button
767,"In typical Quicken fasion, this thing is junk right out of the box - I was unable to log in with my valid Quicken ID. I it's valid case I can log in ths Quicken web site but not this dumb app - was this developed by the same dummys that did the Quicken Mobile app cause that is junk as well - ugh"
768,"I cannot fathom how anyone uses this app, let alone pays for it. It's not at all user friendly - after THREE attempts to create a budget, I still haven't figured out how to add my income. You'd think this would inspire developers to provide some kind of assistance beyond tutorials that explain what an expense is, but nah. There's not even a Contact Us or Support option on the WEBSITE, which is really just an uglier version of the mobile app. Seriously, soon as you log in, the www changes to app"
769,I was really excited to use this app but when I tried to link my accounts I couldn't find coast capital as an option and if I have to input my own transactions what's the point of paying for a subscription I could do that on my own if im doing something wrong and coast capital is an option please let me know and I'll quickly change my review
770,"Extremely unhappy that this app holds my information hostage if I don't subscribe. My trial ended and I can't even delete my accounts, just log out. For an app that wants to ""help"", I don't think I could trust it now."
771,Was not aware that this was a subscription app and put all my budgetting info on it and now it wants me to subscribe and I can't even my budget so far to be able to transfer the information somewhere else
772,"This app is so confusing to use. There's no tutorial for help setting it up. I'm googling to find out how to use it, but that's no help. I'll just stick to pen and paper!"
773,"For an application that lists bank syncing as the first key feature it is also the one that I continually have the most issues with. One account hasn't worked for months, others have constantly delayed imports, and some have to be reconnected frequently. Be sure to check out their status page to see if your financial institution is having problems before signing up. They really need to find a different partner for syncing transactions."
774,The Android app can't interact with synced pending transactions like the web app and iphone app can. UPDATE: You can't even reconcile your account with the mobile version. I can't imagine using YNAB without routine access to a pc web browser
775,Was really excited to try this app. But then after an attempted login it said it currently does not support two-factor authentication. Utterly disappointed. I should not have to make my login less secure in order to link the account. And if I wanted to just manually input my transactions I would go use a free app. Will change my rating and my willingness to purchase service when and if this feature is implemented.
776,The layout of the mobile app is far less optimized of a user experience than the browser version. It's different enough that there's quite a learning curve to use the app after already becoming familiar with the browser version. I'd rather just have a clone of that in the app. This sucks.
777,Received a notification telling me to log back in. Tried. It can't find my email or account. Lovely considering my bank info is connected to the app.
778,"Doesn't Support My Bank. I tried setting it up with RBC because I was so excited to use this app, and it doesn't support my bank, which makes it impossible to use this account. If this gets fixed, I will change my rating, but until then, I stand beside my 1 star."
779,"Loved it for 2 days, then it quit syncing. Zero response from customer service, and even after reconnecting the account 3 times, it just says ""delayed"". Huge waste of time setting it up."
780,The app is showing the same amounts in my accounts for over a week. What is the point of a budgeting app that won't register deposits or allow me to input them manually? Am I supposes to keep budgeting the amount I had 12 days ago?
781,My free trial is about to end and I've spent over an hour trying to figure out how to cancel before I get charged. Why would they make it so tricky to cancel?
782,"Terrible. This app does not properly generate income from direct deposits, does not properly take income into account when creating a budget and despite these shortcomings is a paid only app."
783,"Wanted to like it but they made it so difficult to use it's not even worth it. Just going to stick to my Google spreadsheet budget tools and save an entire headache. The rep that attempted to walk me through the steps was nice, but even when she was trying to explain it, the app is so poorly designed it wasn't easy to follow. Will try again if they add some decent UI and usability updates."
784,"Just like all other ""budgeting"" apps.. this one is confusing to use. I added my bank account and it adds my auto loan and mortgage to the category of net worth rather than debt. There's got to be an app out there that functions more like a spreadsheet with the advantage of having my bank account added to it. Back to continuing my search. Might have to hook up with a developer to create something useful..."
785,"I'm trying to open for the first time and it keeps telling me ""incorrect password."" So i tried to use the password reset and it also tells me ""incorrect password."" How do i open the app??"
786,This app will suddenly tell you to log out after trial period over but they will never mention about trial period when you start using it so you may loose your data suddenly and unexpectedly. Rest all fine.
787,None of my connections work. There is 0 customer support. This app is ironically a complete waste of money.
788,Not free and doesn't mention it upfront
789,"It's free for 34 days but nowhere does it tell you how much it costs, and how much 'they' will refund you if you don't save money with it! I chose to skip the free trial!"
790,"I loved this app, but the fee breaks my heart. I just can't commit to anything more than a monthly subscription and I cannot fathom why they wouldn't offer a monthly subscription rather than forcing your hand to pay over $80.00 in one shot. When you hunt down a budgeting app, you're looking to get control of your spending habits, I wouldn't even commit to that with Microsoft and I'm a religious daily user of their software. If they change their subscriptions and offer alternatives to just paying yearly then I'll change my review."
791,"so it's a cool idea that needs an undo button or some serious renovation. if you mess up one item it throws everything overboard and you have to start over from scratch. also, don't bother syncing your bank accounts. if you go ahead and put a receipt into your budget ahead of time, the app will hound you to deal with these transactions and will duplicate them (sometimes including every single one you've ever had) throwing your accounts off."
792,"Doesn't properly sync with accounts, money is always way off. Without this feature there's nothing special to it."
793,"Get ready to learn another language. This app is incredibly confusing. I've watched tutorials and read articles and read discussions online for hours and hours and I'm over it. I'm a brilliant person, and I could not figure this out. Unless you're willing to enter every single thing manually ahead of time, this app is way too slow to keep up with your spending anyway. The whole point in getting this app was to make budgeting easier. This failed me. It needs an entirely new user interface."
794,"i tried this and a few other budgeting apps out and chose another. when I tried to delete the account, this was made extremely difficult. First having to use a computer as It could not be done on the app (which is ridiculous), then having to set a seperate password so that i can input it before being allowed to delete the account, which makes no sense in terms of security. Very shady behaviour."
795,i tried this app about few years ago and decides it has too many issues and didnt thought it was worth the time. i came back to see if ynab is usable this time and after reading the reviews i saw that nothing has changed. issues i had few years back are the same issues people are complainimg this month. i havent seen anyone from ynab respond to any comments. its very obvious this company simply doesnt care. for $7 a month i expect far beyond what this company is putting in. its a shame
796,"This has evolved from an app you pay up front for, to a program that is no better than YNAB Classic that you have to pay monthly or annually to keep. Ridiculous waste of money. We purchased this program a few years ago and then they discontinued it in favor of a monthly/annual program that they continuously charge you to to use. It's a rip off. The mobile version is not user friendly. You can't reconcile in the mobile app and you have to contantly resync it to use it."
797,"decided to give another try. First day back; app syncingn is broken. Response from developer: ""We are experiencing extremely high volumes of users trying to access YNAB today, which has caused us to turn off the syncing from mobile to the computer. Our developers are aware and working on a solution as quickly as possible. Everything will sync both ways once it's resolved! It isn't something that happens regularly, but with all of the new budgeters who made New Years resolutions, we're working """
798,"Good, not great, app. Overpriced with a key advertised feature only working part of the time and getting worse. Biggest problem is Veronica, Faness, and Nicole on their ""support"" team. Not only are they shutting down complaints about direct importing, the primary selling point of the software, but they're blocking people who point out that it looks like they're trying to hide something. Jesse either doesn't know this is going on or he's complicit. Neither is a good look. I've moved to a free option that does 95% of what YNAB does and will probably catch it soon."
799,"Backwards and Complicated. Unfortunately I have to agree with the others, the concept is good but even after several hours of playing around, watching videos and reading their site, its impossible to actually put the app to any use. The devs have done their best, but the app seems to be designed more for people with pre existing funds to divide up, rather than for people with ongoing expenses, debts and incomes to track and stay on top of. Basically, useless."
800,There is no significant difference to the other apps. In fact it is difficult to navigate from creating goals to encoding my daily transactions. This app claims that it's easy to use but I don't find it easy to use. I'm almost doen with my trial and still get confused and I want to stop my trial version because they might charge me automatically but then even in unsubscribing i couldn't found an unsubscribe link!!
801,"The app and service were very nice and pretty seemless up until a few months ago when an issue relating to Discover card info not automatically importing to show if payments actually cleared. It has now been a few months since then and it's still not fixed. If YNAB was a free service, I would be understanding if issues like this occurred. The problem is that YNAB is not free and the yearly subscription is at a premium compared to others. This is why I feel this app/service deserves 1-star. Fixit"
802,The worst budgeting template with the best idea. I liked the idea of assigning all my money a job. I liked that it works with what's in my bank right now. However it's a budget. Ya add and subtract. This adds so many unnecessary layers without an initial walk through that the rest of the service is worthless. It's a budget. I shouldn't need 4 youtube tutorials and blogs to figure out how to use your site. I deleted everything within 3 days. Back to an Excel sheet and basic math.
803,"this app is awesome, but i am not payong $85 a year for it. im sorry but thats A LOT of money for something thats supposed to save you money. Really doesn't make any sense to me. The app over all is great though. If there was a free version with less features or the annual plan was only 40 or 50 Id come back to it. but as it stands, no thanks."
804,"Everyone said how great this was ... I don't get it. Is the theory we will make doing your budget such a chore you will never want to spend money. Security and data retention huge issues as well. For security, if you update your username with one of your banks, YNAB will never accept it as same account. Data retention, if you cancel, you lose access to all the info you ever put in there. Despite charging more for less services, you can't even access your data for reference when you cancel"
805,"Super frustrated with YNAB. I hate their system and way of screwing you over on the first of each month. The good: nice layout, great job pulling regular updates from the bank (this is the reason I use them). The bad: defaults to the wrong month constantly, can’t rename things on the app, have to go to the web, MOVES MONEY WITHOUT ASKING. Yes, that is right, the biggest issue I have is that on the turn of the month, it just moves your money without asking to cover negative envelopes....DO NOT MOVE MY MONEY! I want those negative as I am expecting reimbursements. What does some generic, end of the month, have anything to do with when you do this anyway??? Most people get paid every 2 weeks, so “end of month” is some relative bogus selection anyway. Most importantly, your philosophy is great...philosophically. Not in the real world. Work reimbursements need to go negative, allowance envelopes, heck pretty much ANY envelope I choose to go negative should be left alone. DO NOT MOVE MY MONEY! This creates a MASSIVE amount of time and effort to go back and forth to put the money back where it belonged. This is ridiculous."
806,"Big selling point was that it would download transactions. I've had this service for over a year and have paid $84 twice now. I've constantly had errors with my financial institutions working with YNAB. Customer service seems nice but their suggestion was to not connect to the banks and to just enter all of them manually. So I did that for all my accounts but the main, but that doesn't connect or has a few days lag before downloading transactions. Completely doesn't work now."
807,"App has lots of potential. it doesn't link previous transactions to the day you start, make sure its the first day of the month when you start. The bad part is once it syncs with your bank it might not do it again for hours or days; my CC and banks are always off sync. Has serious problems staying linked to credit cards. Now it supports less banks. The customer service denies issues and gives the most useless ""fixes"", like ""import it"" or ""enter by hand""."
808,"This used to be a pretty awesome app but after the turn of the year, the connections to my bank have been unreliable. Instead of taking ownership of the problem, technical support blames their Direct Import Partner. They are the ones paying the partner for a service and should be the ones to find a new partner when the current one fails to deliver. Technical support says the app is great without autoimport feature from the bank. I disagree. This is clearly bait and switch (fraud)."
809,"I was, and would still be, really excited to try this out. But they don't sync up with my bank (TD Canada) and, from a quick online search, they haven't for >10 months. If this was fixed I would change my review and subscribe right away. I wonder if this is TD's fault, since they're making [worse but related] proprietary apps. I will pester them too."
810,"Don't get it if you don't also have a desktop computer to use. The functions of the app are minimal, and most of the resources are desktop only....no tablet, no phone, nothing portable. And the support is not timely and not helpful. Definitely don't recommend."
811,I have had this app recommended to me several times as I have been looking for a budgeting app. The app is complicated and there is a huge learning curve that I haven't even had the opportunity to try because it takes days to update from your bank. AND I have had a lot of problems syncing the app to my bank account for spending updates. Will be deleting this app and searching for something that is more simple.
812,"Sucks. Poor approach to budgeting as a way to differentiate themselves in a saturated market makes for a waste of time. Trying to remove my financial accounts once I decided to stop using was excruciating. App won't let you do so, forces PC use to delete/cancel accounts when PC was not part of the sign up process. My advice is skip this huge risk from start."
813,"I paid $50 for YNAB for myslef, not to mention buying it for several friends. The company decided that it'd be more profitable to switch to a season pass model instead of a flat fee, and they retroactively discontinued support for people like me, meaning the app and services I paid them for are no longer available. This is a company that seriously lacks integrity."
814,"Downloaded app after reading a few positive articles. Added my bank account and tried if for a bit but found it wasn't what I was looking for. No big deal. Fast forward a week and I get an email from my bank that someone has tried to log into my account but got my security question wrong. Never had this happen before and within a week of linking to this app someone gets my login info... don't trust this app, manually enter transactions if you choose to use it."
815,"Hi, You can't take credit for savings in a budget as part of the price of the product, any more than you can borrow against potential returns. Why try to fool everyone with a monthly fee due with the year in ad b.c. ance, when you actually want $83 for the software. Why not just come out and say the software is $83. These marketing gimicks made me fearful of committing."
816,"If you plan on linking to a bank, you're screwed. It barely has the direct import function. You have to repeatedly relink bank accounts to get current information. They say they are testing importing pending transactions when they can't do settled transactions right yet. The platform is confusing so plan on spending hours with YouTube videos trying to figure it out. And support is dismal on a good day. But they never miss debiting your account $11.99 a month. That bank link works fine. 🙄"
817,This app is ridiculous. If you have capital one don't bother. It has problems with this bank credit cards all the time and they don't even bother to try to fix it despite many complaints by customers that you can find online. I was a paying customer but not anymore. I suggest everyone to use alternatives that actually work and not just pretend to and charge you for nothing.
818,"At the end of 2018 I tried a free 3 month trial of YNAB & absolutely LOVED the way it helped me manage my money. However, after paying for a years subscription YNAB lost connection with my bank, making the Bank Sync function useless. Customer service explained this is an issue with their Direct Import Partner that they are working on resolving - it's been 5 months and it still doesn't work. YNAB encouraged me to use the direct import option which is cumbersome & not worth my time. So disappointed"
819,Have heard great things about YNAB for years and was ready to finally take the plunge. Downloaded the app and it won't connect to my bank accounts. I don't even get an error--it just starts to verify and then stops. Seems like lots of other people are having these issues as well. Uninstalled.
820,"Worst Budget App I've Tried. It only works from the day you connect accounts, it cannot pull past transactions. If you don't start right before a new month it seems to mess up the budget going forward because it sees things that were already spent/utilized. Starting was not user friendly or intuitive. It wants you to allocate all money without seeing the transactions, which seems good except I had issues with savings that messed with future budget amounts."
821,Transactions don't get imported for many days after clearing. Used to be quick but the import service provider changed this year and now it's very slow to import transactions so the convenience factor is gone. On top of the delays I constantly have to reenter my username and passwords for banks. I will not be renewing when my subscription is up. When transactions used to import within a day or two I loved the app but now not so much.
822,"⚠️Just not enough bank, creditor and lending link options.⚠️ Issue: Credit One Bank not listed and I worry as their will be too many manual entry required to maintain a updated profile. A loan is 1 thing 1 or 2 transaction per month but a bank or credit card account can't be overlooked in any linked Account list. It's more work then I wish to manage. A budget should be clean, simple and updated without much effort from the user. ***Unless new debt (-) or assets (+) become available.***"
823,"This application does not synchronize accounts so you need to continuously enter transactions and manually resolve balances. You're paying to balance a checkbook every day or so with a kludgy interface. It's impossible to conveniently track money in realtime. There are other, better products on the market that actually sync your accounts. The terrible part is that YNAB used to synchronize accounts without a problem but they keep releasing new software versions that break functionality."
824,Extremely difficult to use with no intuitive features. I used it on an iPad and my Android phone and both were very complicated and lacked any kind of straightforward training. I purchased the YNAB book and found great information on there. I would suggest you skip the app and just read the book and use Excel to build your budget. Hate that I paid for two months of this inscrutable headache.
825,"After little over a year of not using YNAB, I had the ide of checking out what new bells and whistles this new version has, and eventually switching back. So I took my licence key from my password manager, downloaded the app. Two minutes later, and I'm writing this 1 star review. No way in hell I'm gonna pay almost $100 a year, for a software I already purchased, and after reading the other reviews, I'm not missing out on anything. Definitely not something worth $12/month."
826,"2nd Attempt. Still can't figure out how to make this work, even after listening to the audio book. Beginning to think that I'm smart enough to get an education and excel at a career, but hopeless about money. The app/YNAB system just serves to reinforce it, not actually help in any way. Only download if you already ""get it""."
827,"Pretty pointless if you know how to make a spreadsheet. And once you sign up (using the app for example) you can only delete your account from desktop. I'll be doing this asap. First thing they ask is your bank account details. That's a hard no from me. Optional or not, that dog don't hunt. Recommended avoiding this like the plague."
828,"This app is the worst. You can't change any of the budget categories. There are almost no instructions, making startup very difficult. Once you get started, you can't change or edit anything on the mobile version and you have to log into a desktop to modify or delete your account. Almost useless for budgeting."
829,"Cant get into it. Its set up rigidly in a monthly format which doesnt work at all with my bi-weekly commitments. I tried to look up tips to work around this on their site as well as reddit, and the best that can come up with is that for bi-weekly payments set it up like (payment)x26÷12 to get your monthly payment, but the problem is that you're not actually balancing anything then and I thought the whole point was to avoid floating bills and cash. Easier to just down on a paper so its flexible."
830,"The book was amazing but this app can feel very clunky and hard to fully grasp? I keep finding myself confused when trying to use it and getting flustered and overwhelmed. I WANT to be able to use it, I just don't fully get it? I just found out that the online program is $5 but I would hate to pay for it and end up with the same dissatisfied results."
831,I was a subscriber for many years...$50 a year. It was pretty good...then they could no longer sync with my bank....they were unhelpful .. unapologetic...so I cancelled -- I thought about trying them again....now they want $83 a year and still can't connect to my bank! Nope.
832,After sign up i can use but it suddenly logged me out. I tried to login again but it kept saying that i need to verify my account. I have verified the first time and verify again each time i request to login still cannot login. Now i cannot use it..so far has been using less than 30mins..not as flexible where i can create my own categories bit complex to tweak around..can't give full review since i can't really use it..not recommended based on reasons above
833,One of the most basic useless budget apps I have ever used. I have done way more with an Excel sheet then this app ever did for me. I was looking for something that helped me budget more automatically but there wasn't anything automatic about this at all. Lucky they have a free trial because this is a waste of money.
834,"YNAB (You Need a Better App) This app crashed on my LG at least 3 times daily. There are EXTENSIVE tools to learn how to use the app, including live lessons streamed everyday! Isn't that great? Want a quick way to look at your finances? Download YNAB, spend a few hours watching videos and reading tutorials and you're good to go! I wanted to allocate money to my child's daycare and her after school activities. There was NO budget category for kids. Using Mint instead.. Or paper..."
835,"The app was ok, the site much better , but the real kicker was the inability to direct import from my bank like it's supposed to. That made me very sad. I struggled to make this work for 9 MONTHS, and finally said enough was enough."
836,Wanted to love it but....after trying NUMEROUS times to automatically import my transactions it would never work. the automatic import feature was one of the top reasons i wanted to try this app. manually adding every transaction can be tedious and frankly isnt necessary with apps like this....well if it actually worked 🙄
837,This app hasn't been helpful. I tried the trial and would not link to any of my accounts. Says there's a connection issue to all of them. Clearly this is an issue to the app. Don't think I'll be subscribing. I am already using a great budgeting app that is free to use and links to all my accounts.
838,"Too expensive for non-US standards, needs regional pricing. No multi currency, no account link outside North America. Can't even read bank sms/app notification like some other free apps can for semi automatic transactions. Web UI is nice and slick, but app is complete garbage. It's 2020 and app still doesn't have dark mode. From yesterday I can't even login. 0/5"
839,"This app used to be amazing. I bought an older version years ago, on sale, with a one time fee. I wanted to try the new version with my partner but $12 USD a month is an incredibly steep price to pay for the basic wants that him and I have, or most people who are trying to do basic budgeting."
840,"Unable to modify the amount in the available column... Tried to modify but the system is asking me to move money... That's retarded, because I didn't spend money for something doesn't mean that I still have that money available... We should be able to plan each month independently... Without having to contact support..."
841,"Bank syncing is terrible, and that's a major factor for me. I haven't gotten a sync from my bank in weeks. When I asked support, they politely told me that they had been having problems with my bank and didn't know why, so I'd have to import a file from my bank or enter everything manually. That's not what I paid for, and I don't have time for that. I'm disappointed, and will be canceling my subscription. I'm just upset that I wasted so much money in an effort to budget."
842,"App has been nerfed. it no longer connects to drop box. used to be great until it focused on monetizing and taking your money. basically you don't buy the app, you rent it because there is more profit for them. fortunately I have an old version on my PC which uses drop box. bought the app outright and has no running costs"
843,"Can't login to the website on a mobile phone. Even if you open the ynab home page and force the desktop version, when you go to log in it opens the app. I like to use the desktop version sometimes. I don't like being forced to use the app."
844,"Huge learning curve folks. Going from zero knowledge to this is very overwhelming. I'm not sure what's really going on. Also please use false information (bank info, bank balance) at first or until you want to invest with your real hard earned money. A month trial is to short in my opinion. With 98% of schedule withdrawals being on a monthly payment it doesn't give you an idea as to really going on."
845,"Nowhere in the app or app store does it tell you the pricing for after the trial and then BAM! 12 bucks a month after trial. No thanks. I don't want my bank info saved forever on a server somewhere so I'll delete my account, should be easy right? But the app is locked out after free trial so I can't remove my banking details or delete my account. Says I must log into desktop website to delete account. Well it's 2019 not 2001 not everyone is using AOL on their Dell desktop computer anymore. Awful"
846,"Service used to be great, but over the last the few months I can no longer link my bank accounts or credit card account. Ynab's 3rd party vendor has been working on a resolution to fix access to my bank accountd for over a month now with limited updates and as of today I cannot import my credit card transactions. Ynab is in a sad state at the moment which may force me to seek an alternative."
847,Prepare to have your email sold prior to being bombarded with new junk. Thanks to installing THIS APP. I never feel alone. Constant emails and text messages make this a super annoying and privacy invading experience. THIS APP DOES NOT MIND IT'S OWN BUSINESS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
848,"So after inputting 2 hours of information, of all my expenses and wages; the next day...there she be...gone. Each step I saved. Turns out the app only saved what it wanted. Yes, I'm pissed. Good thing this is the trial version. It failed."
849,Lots of sync issues. Transactions are only updated twice a month so makes it really hard to budget properly. Will be looking for a better budgeting app. I think it would have been a good app if it actually worked properly.
850,App simply doesn't work. Accounts become disconnected and will never reconnect. Ever. Allegedly connected accounts show pending and never actually update. It was months and support was of no help. I don't want to have to delete my account every few months to have a functioning one.
851,If you are using a bank other than those chosen by YNAB you will need to log into each account every time you use the app and sometimes while you're using the app. From that issue alone it's not worth it. I asked for a refund with no reply.
852,"Im getting email spam every day with no easy option to unsubscribe from email and no option to delete the account unless you use a desktop pc. if it is this hard to stop spam, I can only imagine how difficult it is to cancel a membership."
853,"Was great until it logged me out because my trial had expired. As if it ever warned me I was in a trial mode. And of course the app costs 80+ dollars a month. If it had an option to pay a single month I would have. Taken it otherwise, no thanks."
854,"When you make a budget plan, you don't save anything, you just spend more wisely. With this app. you are out $80/year that you could have spend on other something better. Instead of helping, they pray on the people that need help the most."
855,I gave it a one full day entering a month worth of receipts in manually. To say this app is not a user friendly is not to say anything. I totally didnt see anything more than my online banking already offering. Confidently moving on to trying different apps now
856,"This is absolutely the most complicated app ever. The concept is amazing but actually putting the app to use is beyond frustrating. I have spent hours upon hours reviewing youtube videos and with ynab customer support and I just cannot figure it out. Unless you are particularly tech savvy, STAY AWAY!!"
857,Couldn't connect to the server. I liked the reviews so I installed the app. I couldn't connect to the server to even sign up. it didn't matter if I was connected to my home wifi or cell data. very frustrating.
858,Make a desktop app or bring back YNAB Classic. It was the best personal budgeting software available until they sunset the desktop client and went full browser before it was even slightly ready. Thinking about switching after seven years. They seem to have just completely ceased development.
859,Import is constantly broken
860,I've used the app for several years. The app used to function but now accounts become disconnected and it's not possible to import transactions. It used to be a great app but it just sucks lately. I recommend you find an alternative.
861,"Bought the software when it came out on pc years ago, noticed it was free on my phone so I downloaded it to try it out. After one month of use they want me to pay 12 bucks per month or 80 per year for software thats not even useful to me."
862,"Setup all of my accounts, no option to import transactions. Go to desktop website, ""no transactions to import."" Look up fixes online which suggest to delete account and relink. This works to import transactions for my checking account, but still states ""no transactions to import"" for my credit card. Should be a disclaimer to setup accounts in the website first! Huge waste of time, cannot believe a paid service is this difficult to use."
863,"No support for UK bank connections even though the UK now has secure open banking. This has been an issue for years, since the feature went live for the US. Nothing but excuses from the company, including the international market not being a priority in their forum responses for the issue."
864,Great in theory but ultimately useless. The app wouldn't load any information from my bank. It literally did nothing I couldn't create in an excel spreadsheet. Why on earth would anyone pay for this?
865,"ynab sucks. ynab can't keep the bank accounts synced up which screws up everything with double inputs after you do finally get it to sync weeks later . I'm looking forward to finding a different option. Update-I'm trying MINT, or any other option at the beginning of the year"
866,"80+ dollars a year for an app that is super manual? If I wanted to do this manually I could save that and get a spreadsheet. prism let's you hook up ALL your accounts, not just banks like ynab, and you can pay your bills through it for free. YNAB is just a pretentious spreadsheet."
867,"wow... this sucks. can't even account for retirement. it has to be stuffed into ""fun money"" as an overflow category. My 2004 Microsoft Money is a better program than this and it doesn't have the ability to connect to banks because it's no longer supported. take notes from that old program and maybe you can have a decent app. if I don't have enough room here to type out all the problems I found with this. if you need to take a class for this then it's probably too difficult to use. bad app"
868,I was really excited to use this app but when I tried to link my accounts I couldn't find coast capital as an option and if I have to input my own transactions what's the point of paying for a subscription I could do that on my own if im doing something wrong and coast capital is an option please let me know and I'll quickly change my review
869,This app will suddenly tell you to log out after trial period over but they will never mention about trial period when you start using it so you may loose your data suddenly and unexpectedly. Rest all fine.
870,"I cannot fathom how anyone uses this app, let alone pays for it. It's not at all user friendly - after THREE attempts to create a budget, I still haven't figured out how to add my income. You'd think this would inspire developers to provide some kind of assistance beyond tutorials that explain what an expense is, but nah. There's not even a Contact Us or Support option on the WEBSITE, which is really just an uglier version of the mobile app. Seriously, soon as you log in, the www changes to app"
871,Why a subscription though?
872,Was not aware that this was a subscription app and put all my budgetting info on it and now it wants me to subscribe and I can't even my budget so far to be able to transfer the information somewhere else
873,I wanted to use this app but it does not have South Africa Currency
874,"Wanted to like it but they made it so difficult to use it's not even worth it. Just going to stick to my Google spreadsheet budget tools and save an entire headache. The rep that attempted to walk me through the steps was nice, but even when she was trying to explain it, the app is so poorly designed it wasn't easy to follow. Will try again if they add some decent UI and usability updates."
875,"Still no real updates or improvement to this app. ""update"" after ""update"" and still no real improvements! Split transaction are not the norm and should not be suggested the next time a transaction is entered. App needs a ""simple"" view mode that does not allow budget changes, only viewing current budget and the ability to add transactions. It is way to easy to accidentally change budget when you don't want to."
876,Import is constantly broken
877,I suggest try the free trial and then do it yourself. Not worth 6 plus a month
878,"This app is so confusing to use. There's no tutorial for help setting it up. I'm googling to find out how to use it, but that's no help. I'll just stick to pen and paper!"
879,"Just like all other ""budgeting"" apps.. this one is confusing to use. I added my bank account and it adds my auto loan and mortgage to the category of net worth rather than debt. There's got to be an app out there that functions more like a spreadsheet with the advantage of having my bank account added to it. Back to continuing my search. Might have to hook up with a developer to create something useful..."
880,Too complicated.
881,"Extremely unhappy that this app holds my information hostage if I don't subscribe. My trial ended and I can't even delete my accounts, just log out. For an app that wants to ""help"", I don't think I could trust it now."
882,Not free and doesn't mention it upfront
883,The Android app can't interact with synced pending transactions like the web app and iphone app can. UPDATE: You can't even reconcile your account with the mobile version. I can't imagine using YNAB without routine access to a pc web browser
884,Received a notification telling me to log back in. Tried. It can't find my email or account. Lovely considering my bank info is connected to the app.
885,None of my connections work. There is 0 customer support. This app is ironically a complete waste of money.
886,"Doesn't Support My Bank. I tried setting it up with RBC because I was so excited to use this app, and it doesn't support my bank, which makes it impossible to use this account. If this gets fixed, I will change my rating, but until then, I stand beside my 1 star."
887,My free trial is about to end and I've spent over an hour trying to figure out how to cancel before I get charged. Why would they make it so tricky to cancel?
888,Was really excited to try this app. But then after an attempted login it said it currently does not support two-factor authentication. Utterly disappointed. I should not have to make my login less secure in order to link the account. And if I wanted to just manually input my transactions I would go use a free app. Will change my rating and my willingness to purchase service when and if this feature is implemented.
889,The layout of the mobile app is far less optimized of a user experience than the browser version. It's different enough that there's quite a learning curve to use the app after already becoming familiar with the browser version. I'd rather just have a clone of that in the app. This sucks.
890,The app is showing the same amounts in my accounts for over a week. What is the point of a budgeting app that won't register deposits or allow me to input them manually? Am I supposes to keep budgeting the amount I had 12 days ago?
891,"YNAB as a budgeting tool is good but, there's still a lot of room for improvement. I'm disappointed that the app still doesn't have Account Reconciliation as a feature. The lack of multi currency support / integration is also disappointing. Lastly the reports on web aren't great, and they are non-existent in the app. Hopefully these get added sooner than later, as the app is lagging behind despite the high annual membership fee."
892,"I'm trying to open for the first time and it keeps telling me ""incorrect password."" So i tried to use the password reset and it also tells me ""incorrect password."" How do i open the app??"
893,Rubbish. Pay to use
894,"Terrible. This app does not properly generate income from direct deposits, does not properly take income into account when creating a budget and despite these shortcomings is a paid only app."
895,"Doesn't properly sync with accounts, money is always way off. Without this feature there's nothing special to it."
896,"For an application that lists bank syncing as the first key feature it is also the one that I continually have the most issues with. One account hasn't worked for months, others have constantly delayed imports, and some have to be reconnected frequently. Be sure to check out their status page to see if your financial institution is having problems before signing up. They really need to find a different partner for syncing transactions."
897,Can't link to my bank in Canada
898,Wasn't what I was looking for. Just annoyed over the fact that in order to delete my account that I need to use a laptop or desktop. Not helpful.
899,"Loved it for 2 days, then it quit syncing. Zero response from customer service, and even after reconnecting the account 3 times, it just says ""delayed"". Huge waste of time setting it up."
900,Poor design. Unintuitive
901,Worst app I've ever invested my time into
902,Not good for EU
903,Automatic transaction import is US and Canada only
904,Super conter intuitive
905,"It's free for 34 days but nowhere does it tell you how much it costs, and how much 'they' will refund you if you don't save money with it! I chose to skip the free trial!"
906,"Yet another app developer who doesn't really read people feedback before responding, as I haven't even subscribe and if they read my previous feedback the developer can see why."
907,"Setup all of my accounts, no option to import transactions. Go to desktop website, ""no transactions to import."" Look up fixes online which suggest to delete account and relink. This works to import transactions for my checking account, but still states ""no transactions to import"" for my credit card. Should be a disclaimer to setup accounts in the website first! Huge waste of time, cannot believe a paid service is this difficult to use."
908,I find it annoying and not easily understood.
909,We've had this app for a almost two weeks now and it is not pulling transactions from Bank Of America. We have done all the recommended tricks. Currently VERY disappointed.
910,Didn't like the Privacy Policy. I'd like to use it but don't want to share personal data online.
911,"I downloaded the app, linked my bank account. 12 hours later someone tried accessing my online banking but failed due to not knowing my security question. Seems a bit suspish."
912,I've used the app for several years. The app used to function but now accounts become disconnected and it's not possible to import transactions. It used to be a great app but it just sucks lately. I recommend you find an alternative.
913,Didn't work with Navy Federal
914,Continued to have sync issues constantly. No other choice but to cancel the subscription
915,I don't get the point having used it for many months. Doesn't help save money
916,Went through the trouble of linking my bank account and it doesn't even sync in real-time. Now the app won't update to reflect my bank being unlinked.
917,App simply doesn't work. Accounts become disconnected and will never reconnect. Ever. Allegedly connected accounts show pending and never actually update. It was months and support was of no help. I don't want to have to delete my account every few months to have a functioning one.
918,It's been 6 months that I haven't had automatic imports. Worked fine for the trial and stopped shortly into 1 year. Would recommend if it worked as advertised
919,"Will not link my bank account. Keeps saying that the problem will be fixed shortly. After 2 months of trying to link it I'm confident that's not ""shortly""."
920,"ynab sucks. ynab can't keep the bank accounts synced up which screws up everything with double inputs after you do finally get it to sync weeks later . I'm looking forward to finding a different option. Update-I'm trying MINT, or any other option at the beginning of the year"
921,"Rubbish! You can't budget weekly with this stupid app! How can you just assume that everyone gets paid monthly?? Obviously you didn't put much if any thinking into making this app. And also, they spam you with emails after you sign up! I wouldn't recommend this app to anybody especially if you get paid weekly! Trash!"
922,"I'm not giving anyone my personal info. I been budgeting on my own and will keep up with it. When they want you to log in, I don't trust it"
923,"PLEASE MAKE DARK MODE A SETTING IN THE APP ITSELF, AND NOT TIED TO THE PHONE SETTING!!! I get migraines with white apps, and with my phone in dark mode, I can't see my beautiful van goh theme, and everything's ashen and washed out. 😪"
924,Lots of sync issues. Transactions are only updated twice a month so makes it really hard to budget properly. Will be looking for a better budgeting app. I think it would have been a good app if it actually worked properly.
925,Can only link accounts in N America.
926,Can't add RBC card
927,I was a subscriber for many years...$50 a year. It was pretty good...then they could no longer sync with my bank....they were unhelpful .. unapologetic...so I cancelled -- I thought about trying them again....now they want $83 a year and still can't connect to my bank! Nope.
928,"Super frustrated with YNAB. I hate their system and way of screwing you over on the first of each month. The good: nice layout, great job pulling regular updates from the bank (this is the reason I use them). The bad: defaults to the wrong month constantly, can’t rename things on the app, have to go to the web, MOVES MONEY WITHOUT ASKING. Yes, that is right, the biggest issue I have is that on the turn of the month, it just moves your money without asking to cover negative envelopes....DO NOT MOVE MY MONEY! I want those negative as I am expecting reimbursements. What does some generic, end of the month, have anything to do with when you do this anyway??? Most people get paid every 2 weeks, so “end of month” is some relative bogus selection anyway. Most importantly, your philosophy is great...philosophically. Not in the real world. Work reimbursements need to go negative, allowance envelopes, heck pretty much ANY envelope I choose to go negative should be left alone. DO NOT MOVE MY MONEY! This creates a MASSIVE amount of time and effort to go back and forth to put the money back where it belonged. This is ridiculous."
929,If you are using a bank other than those chosen by YNAB you will need to log into each account every time you use the app and sometimes while you're using the app. From that issue alone it's not worth it. I asked for a refund with no reply.
930,"Needs to support direct linking to UK banks, building societies, credit cards, etc. Other apps manage it."
931,"Has shown the same error about importing from my Venture card for 2 months now. I've linked it and unlinked it a few times like it says. Every time I have something like this happen, I'm expected to do the legwork for YNAB and root out the problem, wait for days for it to be fixed, told why they're blameless...keep waiting... there's never a discount for using YNAB when it goes months without working right though, just the expectation that you'll be ok with it."
932,Tried it and honestly confused the hell out of me. So one star
933,"App has lots of potential. it doesn't link previous transactions to the day you start, make sure its the first day of the month when you start. The bad part is once it syncs with your bank it might not do it again for hours or days; my CC and banks are always off sync. Has serious problems staying linked to credit cards. Now it supports less banks. The customer service denies issues and gives the most useless ""fixes"", like ""import it"" or ""enter by hand""."
934,"Too expensive for non-US standards, needs regional pricing. No multi currency, no account link outside North America. Can't even read bank sms/app notification like some other free apps can for semi automatic transactions. Web UI is nice and slick, but app is complete garbage. It's 2020 and app still doesn't have dark mode. From yesterday I can't even login. 0/5"
935,Been using it for 1 year +. Suddenly logged out and can't log in at all
936,After sign up i can use but it suddenly logged me out. I tried to login again but it kept saying that i need to verify my account. I have verified the first time and verify again each time i request to login still cannot login. Now i cannot use it..so far has been using less than 30mins..not as flexible where i can create my own categories bit complex to tweak around..can't give full review since i can't really use it..not recommended based on reasons above
937,"So after inputting 2 hours of information, of all my expenses and wages; the next day...there she be...gone. Each step I saved. Turns out the app only saved what it wanted. Yes, I'm pissed. Good thing this is the trial version. It failed."
938,"Bought the software when it came out on pc years ago, noticed it was free on my phone so I downloaded it to try it out. After one month of use they want me to pay 12 bucks per month or 80 per year for software thats not even useful to me."
939,"If you plan on linking to a bank, you're screwed. It barely has the direct import function. You have to repeatedly relink bank accounts to get current information. They say they are testing importing pending transactions when they can't do settled transactions right yet. The platform is confusing so plan on spending hours with YouTube videos trying to figure it out. And support is dismal on a good day. But they never miss debiting your account $11.99 a month. That bank link works fine. 🙄"
940,"Used to be a good app until the update to make it subscription based, now it's rubbish"
941,Super confusing app and budgeting system.. was expecting an app I could budget for the future with and it makes that very confusing but only allowing you to budget with the money you currently have available and not the money you will be getting in the future like in a week? Same with accounts if you have money in it but I put previous purchases and credits it puts your account into a negative even if there is money currently in it
942,Doesn't make sense
943,This app is not cool its stupid pls don't get it people who say it is his or hers friend
944,"Downloaded app after reading a few positive articles. Added my bank account and tried if for a bit but found it wasn't what I was looking for. No big deal. Fast forward a week and I get an email from my bank that someone has tried to log into my account but got my security question wrong. Never had this happen before and within a week of linking to this app someone gets my login info... don't trust this app, manually enter transactions if you choose to use it."
945,Sucks. How is that income is not a preset category
946,You have to be using drugs to think we should give some rando app people POWER OF ATTORNEY. Read terms of service people!
947,To much money for this app
948,Requires sign up
949,I followed ynab legacy's advice and don't want to add more monthly bills so I could attain old money. So I won't be using ynab anymore since I can't use my desktop app with ynab legacy.
950,Not user friendly
951,Paid app masked as free
952,"Might be a great idea, still not sure as I can't test it in the UK (no UK banks) I personally think all these features can be integrated into my challenging bank app like revolut or monzo instead of having separate app...there is need for app consolidation. Everyone wants to become rich by creating another app, but this is not in interest of the users"
953,no piecharts can't see yearly overview. no automation and at that price the only balanced budget is there own link to my bank account ya right don't even do that wit my own banks apps
954,"Worst Budget App I've Tried. It only works from the day you connect accounts, it cannot pull past transactions. If you don't start right before a new month it seems to mess up the budget going forward because it sees things that were already spent/utilized. Starting was not user friendly or intuitive. It wants you to allocate all money without seeing the transactions, which seems good except I had issues with savings that messed with future budget amounts."
955,Only for us/canada.
956,"2nd Attempt. Still can't figure out how to make this work, even after listening to the audio book. Beginning to think that I'm smart enough to get an education and excel at a career, but hopeless about money. The app/YNAB system just serves to reinforce it, not actually help in any way. Only download if you already ""get it""."
957,"Pointless Overpriced Calculator and poorly functional ""scratch pad"" Can do the same for free with a calculator and paper. Bank not listed in the bank list. Submitted my bank. Never heard back. Everything must be done manually. Thought this could connect ALL your accounts and automatically fill in things like utility and v phone.. and what you purchased for the day. This app taught me to save $12 a month! Lol Deleted."
958,"Everyone said how great this was ... I don't get it. Is the theory we will make doing your budget such a chore you will never want to spend money. Security and data retention huge issues as well. For security, if you update your username with one of your banks, YNAB will never accept it as same account. Data retention, if you cancel, you lose access to all the info you ever put in there. Despite charging more for less services, you can't even access your data for reference when you cancel"
959,"This app used to be amazing. I bought an older version years ago, on sale, with a one time fee. I wanted to try the new version with my partner but $12 USD a month is an incredibly steep price to pay for the basic wants that him and I have, or most people who are trying to do basic budgeting."
960,We no longer use this app and it charged us without conformation
961,Not much to do with this. Especially in UAE. Just manual typing & nothing special. An excel will do much better than this.
962,Extremely difficult to use with no intuitive features. I used it on an iPad and my Android phone and both were very complicated and lacked any kind of straightforward training. I purchased the YNAB book and found great information on there. I would suggest you skip the app and just read the book and use Excel to build your budget. Hate that I paid for two months of this inscrutable headache.
963,"Less functionality than YNAB 4, but costs USD 12 per month! What a rip off!"
964,Have heard great things about YNAB for years and was ready to finally take the plunge. Downloaded the app and it won't connect to my bank accounts. I don't even get an error--it just starts to verify and then stops. Seems like lots of other people are having these issues as well. Uninstalled.
965,They don't work with my bank and the last year the cost has gone up $35
966,"This application does not synchronize accounts so you need to continuously enter transactions and manually resolve balances. You're paying to balance a checkbook every day or so with a kludgy interface. It's impossible to conveniently track money in realtime. There are other, better products on the market that actually sync your accounts. The terrible part is that YNAB used to synchronize accounts without a problem but they keep releasing new software versions that break functionality."
967,"After the latest upgrade, connectivity to banks is constantly broken. It is annoying and frustrating that it takes days for transactions to appear and also constantly re-enter credentials."
968,"Terrible interface and totally not smooth. The app crashes frequently, support isn't very helpful at all. I wish I could tell everyone just how terrible Chime is. Trying to deposit a money order? NOPE they can't help you and you have to pay $ in order to deposit the money order a physical location. Imagine you have to pay money to deposit money. I had a nightmarish experience setting up my direct deposit. I had 3 different representatives tell me different explanations as to why it was not functioning. Like, I get anxiety whenever I have an issue and I have to contact support. Lol, this app messes with my mental health. I DO NOT RECOMMEND CHIME AT ALL. Email me and ask me. Terrible terrible terrible service."
969,"Very disappointed. The 4 free bank ATMs that were shown in my area when I signed up a few weeks ago apparently are no longer free. Now the only free ATMs in my area are out of the way and either in a high crime area or not 24hr which is not going to work since I work long hours. Oddly, according to the app description in play store (and not the in app map), the ATM that charged me, should still be free. Sadly, I didn't notice the maps had been changed until after I needed an ATM in a hurry."
970,"Worst choice of online banks I've used. They have no problem trying to get you to solicit and harass your contact list for $5 spot mes. Which they don't give half the time. Don't make a mobile check deposit if you actually want your money. They'll hold it for an unacceptable amount of time, but won't release it to take somewhere else. Customer service is a waste of time. Every call you get a different answer to same question and no one can help you anyway. They just read you the faqs. Terrible"
971,"If you like to use your computer for online banking I would possibly suggest looking somewhere else. Had my pay friends feature randomly shut off just because I signed in on my PC. Customer support didn't help that much either. I was actually told that it didn't matter if I kept on using the same PC or not that it might still happen again in the future. Best part, it's either a few hours or 3 to 5 business days and they don't know which. Sad, cause I was really starting to like this bank."
972,"This used to be my favorite banking app. However, 2 months ago, my app quit allowing me to log in. I can log in just fine through Google but not the app. Customer service is no help. All they do is tell me to reset my password and close my ticket. I know my password! The chime APP will not work on my phone now."
973,"They have completely ignored an issue where they report an outstanding payment of 47 dollars to the credit bureaus for over 3 months now. Their latest answer was that they ""just realized"" that the credit bureaus were not updating their reports for the last 2 months and that I can expect it corrected. It was not corrected and it still reports this 47 dollar unpaid balance. It has truly hurt my credit score. Absolutely useless talking to them because they are always right... even when clearly not!"
974,"I'm not going to mince words, this app is terrible. I constantly have to log in & re-log in & verify myself w' passcodes & make up new pins over & over again. I've gotten locked out of my account for hours & I can't count the number of emails & new passcodes I've been sent in texts. It feels like half my day is lost deleting stuff & trying to log in. & the ads! Chime seems aimed at kid gamers who like challenges. I'm an adult who just wants to do my banking. Grow up, Chime. Act like a real bank!"
975,"The app is decent, just as any other online money app. Chime's SERVICE is what's terrible. Chime stole $317 from me on a pending account from Amazon, because it had been longer than the usual ""up to ten days"". Amazon notified me that the transaction never went through, so then where's my money Chime? It was taken from my account the when I ordered, but never was returned. No notice, phone notification, email, letter, nothing. I want my money."
976,I would not recommend Chime to anyone. While I was attempting to scan my driver's license it booted me out of the app and would no longer allow me to register. I attempted to contact support to get the issue fixed. The first person flat out refused to help. I finally got an email from support saying they'd help me fix the issue and asked for my personal info only for me to be told a day later they wouldn't open an account for me. Don't waste your time with chime. Use a real bank or another app
977,The credit builder card reported that I had a balance of $216 instead of it being a payment... it dropped my score 6 points! I double checked and it was definitely an error on they're part but I know there is nothing they can do because it's done. I did dispute it but it's basically in limbo....I have had this credit builder for almost a year and they normally moved my score up but for some reason they filed it wrong. If not fixed their are 3 other cards I have that benefit way better.
978,"Great until my spot me was not used and I incurred 100 in return not pay fees. I had $6 less than the bill in spending account and money in savings and credit builder, with $205.00 in spot me and instead of approving debit and using only $6 of spot me, chime declined the transaction and my insurance was not paid costing $100 in return payment fees and possibly cancellation! So what is spot me good for? Just someone who has no money to repay? What a joke! I am exploring other online banking!!!"
979,"Since I started with Chime, I always got my paycheck the day before by 5am. I recently became a business owner and as soon as my direct deposit increased, my money doesn't show up until the night before or even the morning of pay day. I know when the money is transmitted to the bank. I have called 3 times and I was told my money is not held. This is a lie because the people who transmit the funds leave at 0400 every week day. I'm searching for a new online bank."
980,"I am very upset about the new ATMs. The app states it's a new bigger, better network of ATMs. They didn't mention that the ATMs I've been going to for over 4 years (and one I especially like because I can get $10) are going to now be out of network. Also they are a lot further away. I am very sad and disappointed. :("
981,"I used to love chime. I had lots of my friends and family sign up. They did a review on my account back in May and I provided all the necessary documentation and paperwork and was told that I was fine and that everything checked out so I could continue using my account. Today, with no warning my account has been closed!!! There is a law firm putting together cases against Chime for violating federal regulations on closing accounts and I will be hiring them!!!"
982,I downloaded and installed this app. I got a card sent to me. I set up the card. Two weeks go by and I go to login and besides said my service had been canceled. No explanation whatsoever period trying to get something from them is impossible. Told nothing useful at all. And not even able to sign up again. Complete trash.
983,"I loved this card, then mine was stolen and they took two weeks to tell me my new one was lost in the mail and they couldn't send another one faster than a week. So for two weeks they've had my pay checks and now another week. They're customer service legit does not care at all about anyone."
984,Failed to protect my account. This is not the first time I have had issues with chime customer service not Understanding what I wanted and messed up my account and allowed for multiple fraudulent transactions to be charged even after filing a claim with there fraud department it still went on for multiple hours of charges for $19.57 totalling almost $200 and it was reported after the first charge of $19.57 was made to the account. DO NOT TRUST YOUR MONEY WITH CHIME!!!
985,"I was looking forward on using this app. I entered all my information required and at the end, they lost it and could not create an account so they wanted me to send them the info again by email. If I already uploaded my info, where did it go? Be careful about this app."
986,"It doesn't let me deposit a payroll check because it's in an ""unrecognized format"" but they won't tell me what that means or why I can't deposit it. Instead they push some service that charges you money and is probably owned by them. Makes the entire app pretty much useless to me."
987,Couldnt even get the application done it wouldn't let me hit the allow for camera access so I had to go through my settings by the time I went back to the app to finish taking a picture of my ID it said I was not able to create an account due to security reasons. This app is stupid I didnt even get a chance too start the account
988,I don't know why I can't get online to filled out a application it's just a blank site. This is why I only put one star. And another thing I don't get my mail to my house all of mail goes to the Post office box number here in White Deer Tx. Can I also changed my application on my phone.
989,"When you are in the app it's great. But I constantly get kicked out of it and I have to put my login, get the verification, create a mobile pin. All over again."
990,"Signed up for Chime in April.One of the concerns I had was there was no way to communicate with a person. I needed to know if the 'no monthly fees' still applies if you don't have direct deposit.When I tried to deposit a stimulus check in June, the account was not valid. There wasn't any explanation!"
991,It would be nice if they would actually send the verification code so i can actually set up my chime card but no im stuck pressing resend a thousand times now i remember why i waited so long to get one jus seems like a pain an a waste of time jus trying to log into my chime app so i can verify my card an finally put money on it
992,Ive been using chime about two months lost my debit card requested another one it never came requested another one it never came need bills paid theres a limit u can transfer to friends a month so i transfered funds to my other emails to get the money to pay bills and because i did that they closed my account with after asking my to verify it was me doing the transfers
993,"Im so done with this bank!! Some days it will accept my mobile check deposit, some days it wont, and when it does accept my check it takes over 24 hours to deposit!!??!!! Im going back to Capital One 360. Im never using chime again."
994,I would never use the app again . I transferred money to another account. I had to wait five days to access my money. I don't know why I had to wait so long but it was extremely difficult to explain.
995,"Listen closely, do NOT use Chime!!!! They will f... you over with direct deposits and instead of handling an upset customer, they put you on hold so as to not deal with you. Your deposit never shows up on their end so you're left without funds. They gave no f...s. No apologies for anything so as I told them, I will be leaving a negative review of my experience with them. Save yourself time and energy by avoiding them all together. Cashapp is better. I got Chime as an avenue for my kiddo."
996,They were really good until a hotel kept charging me multiple times I thought they would take care of the situationAnd fix it and get my money back but no they kept saying they found nothing wrong I even sent them proof where I was charged too many times they looked at it for a couple of days and said our decision still stands no proof it was right there So if you ever have to dispute a transaction they are the worst ..Would not recommend at all Better off going to a bank
997,"I filled out your corrupt application three times and it kept saying unfortunately your time has expired and then finally when I did get it filled out I was denied a account because of security reasons and wouldn't tell me what the reason was, it doesn't matter to me if you give me a account or not, it's to your benefit for me to have a account not mine ,"
998,"This is an awful start to my relationship with Chime. I haven't been able to log in. I did send an email to support, however, the lights are on but no one seems to know what they're doing. I don't know if I should email them again. Not sure if I want a Chime account."
999,I love the banking part but the app is so slow on initial startup. It makes me want to switch banks because it's so slow to login and wait for your account info to load.
1000,This has been a hassle from the get go.Second time I had to order another card. I can't get my money out and I refuse to put my bank account number in because now I don't trust them. ITS A PAIN IN THE A$$.I'm about to notify the Better business Beuro.
1001,I thought it was really great until I didn't get any of the benefits for being having my direct deposit set up for it I got rid of my old bank to get this and now I'm regretting that too because I can't even do a mobile check deposit cuz it says setup direct deposit that's been set up since like two weeks after I got the account it's been like 6 months I hit up I hit up customer service robot doesn't work I hit up the1 agent send screenshot of direct deposits from VA told ¹ set up direct deposit
1002,Customer service with company is honestly piss poor! It's been 72 hours and I haven't been able to do things I need to do. I do traveling work so money is something I need daily so them locking my account one time for new device is one thing but noone should be told they have to wait to even feed their family. My 3 children needed extra supplies while I was gone but guess what? Chime made sure my children couldn't get the things they needed from their dad . Hope yall sleep well at night!!!!
1003,Did not want to refund my money!!! When the app crashed and app freezes 🥶 all the time. FYI take screenshots of any errors because if you don't then they will not refund you. Beware
1004,Wow almost a year later. Still can't do mobile deposit for any kind of check.. going to start process of closing all my accounts. Very sad Employees are liars and supervisors don't want to do their jobs. Wife tried deposit a check they wouldn't accept it despite the fact they took the same check from me months ago
1005,"I can't even open an account and they won't give me any reasons to why. Everytime I try to sign up I instantly get take to another webpage that's says ""sorry, you are unable to open an account"" and that's all."
1006,Very deceitful company. They just take away the spotme service from my account on there call. They offer the service and I use it and pay it back. As normal as everybody else. I'm have money to pay back...but the way they doing business..I'm not going to pay back the spotme service...chime will not one penny from me...
1007,First in foremost i have been receving direct deposit in my chime.account $600 and the spot me feature still hasnt been granted to second i think the chime security system is not strong our chime employess or stealing from the chime customera because i was told by chime and gavey accurate information as well was told i won 1000 from one of there prize i never recieced the money because they sent the email to my old email knowin i changed my email with chime so they had my updated email
1008,This app is horrible. My account was hacked and someone took my phone number and email off my account. I cant get into my account. And chime wont let me set up another account. This is crazy
1009,I've sat here an hour trying to set up an account & they keep telling me that both my address aren't recognized and I have to use another one. I only have the 2 so am I just unable to use this service? Am I just out of luck? And finally when I convince my boss to let me use the work address they said I currently can't make an account. Useless
1010,Worst prepaid card I've ever had i basically had the account as a backup card and NEVER used it.. then NOW when I download the app to finally use it i have to apply for a new account . Since when do u need to b approved for a PREPAID CARD??!! RIDICULOUS !!
1011,"worst bank ever. I'm 250 miles from home and you guys cut my cards off and tell me it will be 90 days before I see my money that was wrongfully taken out of my account back again. Meanwhile, you waste my time for 3 freaking days on the phone, getting repeatedly transferred, verifying my account over and over and I still have not gotten any help. I would give negative stars if possible."
1012,"Horrible financial business practices by this company. Limiting ATM will, and daily purchases. As soon as I can pull out all my money from this account, I'm closing it. Not to mention their security company Plaid has phone numbers that have never been associated with me as numbers to verify it's me and that it's me making a transfer. Not happy with Chime at all!"
1013,"The worst online banking. You can't get the app to work, you can't transfer funds online. Support can't help with any problem. They put your account on hold just about everyday. They say your deposits are up to two days early, it's the 10th of the month and my check has not been deposited yet. It's 12 days late. Don't use chime. Terrible, terrible online banking.."
1014,This damn Mobile banking site is not worth two cents I have had nothing but trouble accessing my account all because my card got stolen and I can't give them the last five transactions with amount and place it was used at but mind you I know my social birthday full name card number the three digit security code the expiration date but still I am not able to get them to help me get into my account
1015,Trash bank card. Customer suppoert is awful. If you change phone numbers you risk losing access to your card and money. And without the information that you need from inside the app customer support cant help you.
1016,Dont do it. It has a limit and if you are waiting on a lump sum to pay all your bills you can not do it. Reps do not know anything about the daily limit and i spent two hours over the phone. As soon as i use all the money i will be cutting up my card
1017,It's ok if you don't mind waiting a week to use the money you put in your account. But I don't have time for that and they won't cover any late fees they may cause you because you can't pay your bills even though you have the money.
1018,"Why is it I can't even get past the sign up part!?! Trying to verify my damn ID but it keeps taking blurry photos, like what??? Fix this asap smh, straight up trash"
1019,Very very inconvenient and very hard to get money back out of account ive been waiting almost a month just to get my money back
1020,"Was excited to make the change, but I'm going to be closing my account. You don't state upfront that you need to set up direct deposit first in order to deposit checks with your camera. I don't have an employer. I have no direct deposit. This is a critical piece of information given that you're solely an online bank. This account is now completely worthless to me. It's fine if this is how you operate, but don't suppress that information in the fine print. This was a waste of time for me."
1021,Terrible service I sent all the required info and waited 48 hours for them to lift the suspension only for them to tell me they needed more and that it hasn't been reviewed yet I called the customer service and they were extremely rude and disrespectful ive been evicted from my apartment because I couldn't pay rent because the suspension kept me from accessing my account its been 4 days and still no answer this is ridiculous 😒
1022,"Unable to input passcode and unable to even sign out, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app every time just to sign in."
1023,Their customer service is the absolute worst. Don't trust these people with your money because if you don't have their stupid card (which they will not send me a new one after requesting one just to have the person I was talking stop responding) then you won't ever have access to your money. I've waisted an entire day just to transfer money only to call and then be told after 8 hours of trying to solve my problem and be ignored that it takes 24 to 48 hours to transfer manually. 🙃
1024,"Don't get if you have a p.o. box. They make you jump through hoops and still won't send you a card for security purposes. So they say. I sent all the proof they needed to confirm my address and they would give me a virtual card, not a real one. Full of apologies with no action. Wouldn't have it!!"
1025,"i recieved my card in the mail, went on the app to set up my account and it wont let me past the phone number varifacation. the screen keeps saying ""unable to updaste your information at this time"". im very frustrated at this point, i allready turned in my direct deposit information to my employer and now i cant set up my account? i deleted some apps to free up space and still same screen. what am i doing wrong here?"
1026,"Update notes are not a place for you to advertise or try to be funny. I don't update apps that fail to provide update notes. This app is your sole means to use this account. They make it nearly impossible to get into it via desktop and if you do manage to complete 2 captcha, a challenge puzzle, and 2 step verification you then find you cannot do half of what you can in the app. Blocks me from taking screenshots on MY DEVICE. I'm 40 years old and can make my own damn decisions."
1027,I haven't been able to deposit a check for weeks*and it a very important check* they made my sign the back *ForChimeOnly* and then couldn't recognize what the check was froze my account and now I have a check I can not cash because it was for chime. The solution? Ask for another check to be mailed and try again. So I was supposed to wait another 5 to 10 business days to get another check just for me not to be able to deposit into chime because my account is frozen. Have a second option
1028,Well unfortunate that i had to do this. Had to change my review from a 5 star (extremely satisfied) to 1 star ( will not be recommending this card) customer service and all its represenitives need to be replaced asap. They froze my checking account because they cant identify where my funds are coming from and if they are mine seems kind of sketchy. Sent all documents they asked for only for them to continue to ask for additional information that had nothing to do with the issue. -5stars from me!
1029,"I really like this bank, but the app is horrid. I was forced to install an update before I could use it which really sucks when you are in a rush. I have updated the app twice now and the transfer option has a glitch in it. If I try to transfer money between accounts, the page freezes and wont allow me to do anything without shutting down the app (also does not complete the transfer). Again, chime is a great bank and I love them, but I NEED to be able to transfer my money between accounts."
1030,"I've had this bank with no issues. However, someone got ahold of my account information and took everything leaving me with 1 dollar. Customer service is no help and I might aswell be talking to a wall. Thanks for everything, I plan on changing my banking platform as soon as I'm able and I suggest you do aswell before something happens to you."
1031,"Don't expect to be able to dispute any transaction. I've only tried to dispute a couple, the first was a screen replacement I payed for and didn't ever receive in the mail. They gave no options and they made me wait 2 months to tell me sorry. Then this weekend I attempted to purchase FL studio on Ebay and the person told me to friend to friend the money to lessen transaction times. Again no options givien. If you want your bank to value your money and their time over you as a customer, go for it"
1032,"Terrible about cashing checks, they deny checks for no reason at all. It's the only time I've ever experienced this problem with any bank. They have denied a claim check I received, a child support enforcement payment, a check from my grandma, & many others.. it's just completely ridiculous. That's a very bad trait for a bank smh"
1033,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! I've had Chime for 2.5 years and NEVER had a single issue. Then a month ago while the system was updating (unbeknownst to me) I tried transferring $500 to my husband. Not only was it taken from my account, he never received it!!! I have spent over 30 hours on the phone along with a very detailed dispute ALL FOR NOTHING! They said nothing was wrong on their end and I WILL NOT BE CREDITED MY $500! It makes me absolutely sick! This isn't $5, it's $500!! Chime make this right!!!"
1034,"Switched to this because I thought transfers would be faster but they are actually much slower. They say the transfer takes 3-5 business days. Well it actually takes 6 because you get your money on the CLOSE of the 5th business day. The money was removed from my old checking account after 2 business days. So they hold your money in limbo for the max time they can get away with. Also direct deposit takes FOREVER to setup, mean while they'll send you a dozen messages a day to tell you to set it up!!! So here's to a bunch of return item fees I will have to pay because of their misleading claims. STAY AWAY!"
1035,"Literally always have issues with the app. For some reason when I try to reset the password it doesn't recognize my email address, nor does it recognize my phone number, cust service is difficult as well to get help with as well and due to app failures I'm unable to reset my password for 30 hours they are telling me. But I guarantee when that 30 hours is up I still won't be able to gain access to my account due to problems with the app. Can't get anyone to understand the issue is beyond me."
1036,"Was a wonderful bank at first! I love the easy use, the spot me feature, the credit builder feature. But somehow a stranger got my card info and stole $115 from me in March. Called Chime immediately upon noticing fraudulent transactions and they told me they had to settle first. Started fighting as soon as it settled and have been denied and reopened my case several times. Two months later, still fighting. Great bank unless you get screwed, then they won't give you your own money back."
1037,"Initially I was very happy with this company. Everything seemed great, then they changed my routing number without telling me and none of my bill payments went through, I was flagged late on my credit report and my score dropped almost 100 points. Then they claim that they don't charge fees but I have $110 in fees. Feed they sneak in without you noticing. I've now switched banks. Will not deal with chime ever again."
1038,"Banking made complex. I transferred money into my chime account they're quick to take it out of my regular Bank but slow to put it into my account. When trying to move money I've had to switch money back and forth between my accounts because it always wants to pull from the account that has the least in it. Horrible bank, horrible app, once I get a chance to pull my money out I'm going to close my account."
1039,"Get ready to sign up, like it or NOT!! What more could an app do to be a pain in the arse. I believe this app is designed to make it very difficult to obtain money sent. First, they use terminology that implies a member can send a non member funds. The issues come when the person who was sent money tries to collect or tranafer it to their bank account. If the bank isn't a financial institution that is recognized by Plaid®, then the funds cannot be transferred to your bank account."
1040,They dont have their customer backs im disputing a charge that shouldnt be i contacted the company that supposedly charged me and they provided me proof that they didnt charge me i give chime the proof and they still havent done anything to fix this yet dont understand why it has to take so long i am so mad i switched to chime i wouldnt recommend them if i could rate -10 i would
1041,"This is a warning ⚠️ to all chime credit builder user. The credit builder program that chime is running has a huge glitch in the system which will leave members responsible for pay unexplained mysterious charges that will put your account in the negative for thousands or dollars.i was victim of such charges and now my account is in the negative for 1,134.21 neither customer support nor the tech team at chime can figure out what's going. So please becareful and watch your accounts with chime."
1042,"Had it for a few years with my direct deposit set up, and it was cool...then they decided to just close my account because they felt like it....no explanation...no call....nothing. Now I have to go through everything I pay and change payment methods. This happened on the day I was expecting a check....so Im broke now till everything is fixed with a different bank account. Dont waste your time with them....their customer service is basically non existant."
1043,"Don't use chime at all! So many things that they don't tell you before you sign up. If you have any account problems, good luck getting through and getting the help you need. I tried to take a snap shot of my check to have it deposited. Took 20 minutes for them to finally accept the photos, and an hour and a half later it was rejected. Worst company ever!!!!"
1044,"Don't go to chime I always have bad experiences with them .like freezing my debit card over the weekend, and even when I provided them my credentials there was noone available till Monday morning .this has happened 3x's in a 1year span.2x's left me with my children @ a restaurant on Father's Day 2x's !!!! With no way to pay my bill.horrible! Horrible! Horrendous!"
1045,I had to fight with setting up a new account for a couple hours and still was unsuccessful in making one. I had conflicting error messages between trying to verify my account through the website and through the Chime app. I tried reaching out to the customer service email and received scripted responses that were not helpful. I cannot tell if they were from live people or a bot. Either way I still don't have an account and no path forward to get one
1046,"Horrible bank and customer service! My PayPal account was compromised and I was told to cancel the card I had registered to PayPal. no biggie I was told a new temp online card would be available. Card cancelled, temp card ""temporarily unavailable""!? I call ""ohh no problem should be a few minutes to hours. 7+ days later I'm still being told this! By supervisors no less! No one seems to be able to do their jobs even ""support"".I'm Not even home w/o money!"
1047,4 weeks with this bank and their app is screwing up my direct deposit. Never had any issues with my previous bank. Real fun not getting paid
1048,"So I was in a temporary bind, and needed to use the spot me feature. I've been with Chime since 2019, and used to be able to overdraft 100$. Now you have to have direct deposit of 500!! First not everyone has a typical job like myself and I do not get paid through checks. Second how can you make a system that's automatic!! They say they have no control over the system! I asked if they could use my old direct deposits that total over 500$! They said no the system doesn't recognize it! Terrible!!"
1049,At first this app was working beautifully then one day I signed out of my account to let my cousin sign in his account. Once he signed out and I tried to sign back in it said it couldn't find my account for whatever reason. But I know I have an account cuz I have the damn debit card! And I still get notifications popping up on my iPhone about apps that I paid for it with my chime account. I tried to make a new one and it says I am not able to.
1050,Keep disabling my card and sending me a new one almost every transaction or when I ask the stupid bot a question very frustrating other than having to keep waiting for a new card I guess it's ok
1051,"Just registered for this service 2 days ago & I'm already having mixed feelings. The home page is so clustered wth unnecessary infos. There's no instant way to move money out like zelle or bank transfers, d only way is to give plaid a 3rd party unlimited access to all your personal info if you'r linking an external bank. Imagine my bank sending me a notification to 'blast off' because I've money in my account when other banks are busy showing me how to save money? Getting ready to leave already."
1052,It won't even let me download!!!! Keeps saying there's an error. I have it on my old iphone but now I have a new phone. I don't want to carry around an old phone just to use this so. This is where all my money is. Please fix it I'll have to change banks. Edit: it finally let me download but now I can't even access it cause the first screen asking for pin freezes and I have to restart the app 4 or 5 times to get it to work.
1053,I recommend no one make them a chime account. Knowing there's no physical bank. I end up forgetting my login information and didn't have access to the phone on file. I inbox the chime support team and sent all documentation that they ask for. They enabled my account after about 3 weeks. And I still wasn't able to login or use my card. So just take it into consideration before you register for account with chime. You can only call the number on the back of the card or email them.
1054,I'm pretty pissed actually lately chime has been giving me a hard time by not letting me be able to sign up for the damn credit builder.... my app is up to date which makes no sense and when I click on the link it wants me to make a whole new profile for the spending card.. not the credit builder!!! This needs a hard fix..I have been content with it up until now..kind of makes me want to switch banks..if they cant get this one feature working who's to say they have an actual handle on our money.
1055,"The biggest scam ever, becarefull, chime is a big scam, if anything goes wrong with your account and you can prove that something went wrong, chime is not abilgated to give you anything back , they must side against you, that's how they make their money by ripping people off.."
1056,I'd like to have chime but when I get to the last question it take me back to the hello get started page or denied me I filled the application out 3 times what is wrong .Thank you
1057,"It's too hard to complete transactions. A reputable insurance issued a refund, and my 1st attempt to mobile deposit, NOT ONLY FAILED, BUT IS NO LONGER WELCOME TO BE DEPOSITED IN MY SPENDING ACCOUNT!!!!! Bad form."
1058,It takes weeks to get your credit builder card. Yo. There services don't connect with apps like WalMart pay or Kroger pay. I'm declined every time I use there apps. After being told it was going to be in the mail by may 24th. It's now June 6th no debit card. Going on week three. Oh can't pull money. Or you cannot transfer money from one account to another without a business account number. That doesn't exist in any company computer analog transfer systems.they rob you. Then let you trickle money
1059,I have tried multiple times to contact someone. One of the agents asked me to send a picture of my ID and my social for verification that it was me trying to make an account and no one has got back to me. Id rather not be a victim to Identity theft and thats exactly what it looks like is going on. Id give it zero stars but I can't.
1060,"A fee is charged to deposit cash to the account which should be free anyway. Not a bank, more like an app that accepts money through direct deposit and provides a card. The credit card is also a joke. You have to transfer money in the credit card to use it. How is it a credit card then? How light do you take customers?"
1061,Yes I'm glad I waited til now to give review cuz I've never been more disappointed and disgusted with a bank. They have actually denied $500 worth of bad transactions done by Google and tiktok. I believe along with a lot of friends that they are working with Google. I was hit in 3 accounts and chime is only one refusing to give me my money that they have to see that it was obvious I couldn't have done it !!! So since they were only ones to deny then it's obvious they are bad as well.
1062,"I am actually a manager at a hotel. The reason why I am leaving this review is because Chime is horrible to deal with. We have had numerous issues with extra charges popping up on guests cards, that were never authorized. Now, I have been on the phone with Chime's client and Chime's customer service to correct and give approval for these bizarre additional holds to be released. The company refuses to do anything, and after being transferred for over an hour their supervisor hung up on us."
1063,"My wallet and phone were stolen. At the 1st opportunity I tried to notify Chime of the incident in an attempt to mitigate losses. Without access to the phone app, I attempted to sign on using my computer and Chime's official website. This resulted in ""An attempt to access my account with a NEW DEVICE"" thus Suspending the viewing of my temporary Vitural card. I explained the new device and was assured the hold would automatically remove itself shortly. It took over 24 hours for the hold to lift."
1064,Terrible!!!!! I cant open an account I'm always being rejected for some security reasons that they or their customers service can't explain or fix...soon as i put my information I'm rejected it's been a while now and they did nothing to fix this tells me to email them with a link just to be no help in fixing this issue and just keep bombarding me with ads afterwards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1065,I don't trust this Bank. Now I have to wait another 45 Days. I had to send a 15 pages document. Faxed and email mailed document. I have 3 dispute transaction. Totally 400 worth. They had the nerve to send me a email saying with another dispute number. Just passed this company. There other banks out there.
1066,Very poor customer service team zero compassion our dedication to the client in fact they will recite the entire book on how not to serve you or assist you in any of your banking needs this is definitely not a bank but a mobile Bank app. But to someone who needs a bank right away time is definitely better then some of the alternatives but it's still not a bank or service provider just a app to put your money in and spend it with a debit card they give you
1067,"What's the deal with your mobile check upload? Your camera sucks. Like the worst. Why can't I take a pic and upload it, your thing in the app won't focus . Now your telling me not to try and upload it again, but now it says chime on the back and nobody else will accept it. thanks for that, and the response"
1068,Allowed $600 to be stolen from my account and wouldnt return it. Absolute scam of a company. Dont let these people have access to your money!
1069,I am lots of trouble with their service and customer service it's bad
1070,I think this app sucks because it won't and now they won't even accept my address I've been trying to sign up for 3 weeks and they won't let me get in I think I've ever tried I submitted the same address I did last time and they don't seem to understand that that's my address they had it before and they accepted it once already so I dropped the bank and now they won't accept them damn address I'm not even going to give him with one star I've been living here for 30 years I should know my address
1071,"Chime is by far the worst bank app I've ever seen heard or used . They will lie to you they will tell you one thing and do another they can't get on the same page for nothing in the world. Ive never been more disgusted in my life .I advise anyone considering using them to save there time , energy and most of all they're money unless you want some dishonest ppl handling your money"
1072,I will not be doing future business with chime.
1073,I transfered 2026.00 dollars on Friday and there telling me they don't k now where it is .. what do I do
1074,Trash app
1075,"I have tried a dozen times to open an account but no, I cant!! Chime says due to security reasons, they're not able to open an account for me!!!! I've never had one, been with Netspend for 5 years!! So screw Chime"
1076,My acct was hacked!!;!
1077,Very very poor costomer service they only care about collecting money from people depostiting money i tried this bank and it is very very bad would not recomend it to my worst enemy i had to give one star because they dont have a negative stars l BE SMART DO NOT USE THIS BANK
1078,TERRIBLE !! TERRIBLE !!! I WON'T DOWNLOAD IT EVER ! I'M TELLING EVERYONE HOW HORRIBLE IT IS !! ESPECIALLY THE WAY IT IS NOW !! MAYBE IF THEY FIX IT WE MIGHT GIVE IT A GO .
1079,App doesn't work.. account lost while opening it to registering for free
1080,A joke
1081,If your check doesnt process the first time good luck. You will need to cash it and deposit cash at a store AND PAY A FEE. I believe its a scam. I will be leaving chime asap.
1082,False advertising 200 overdraft free lies
1083,Well iv still not been able to get into my account too add my direct deposit like they say it good but dang..ill change review if they would help me fix the problem js.
1084,No $ made
1085,"I just downloaded the app. Read all the info, it sounded good so I decided to enroll. Answered all the questions, creatived a password and submitted. Within mins I was told they couldn't set up direct deposit for me which means not able to get an account. Even worse than that, they couldn't even tell me WHY they couldn't open an account for me. It's bad enough they didn't approve me for whatever reason, but then to not even give me an explanation. Can't give me an answer, don't need it!"
1086,I have a chime Visa debit card. I try to transfer money from my cash app to my chime card. I can't. Why?
1087,Chime ripped me off 385.00
1088,Won't let me login
1089,Can't even set up an acct without problems
1090,Your app sucks
1091,"ACCOUNT SECURITY IS BAD. They will email other people about your account! I get emails from them every day for some woman named Suzanne in Louisiana who put my email address in by mistake. All I need to log in is the last 4 of her SSN, which I have been guessing for a couple of weeks now. (I'm up to 0894 now and haven't been challenged or locked out.) I'll be in her account soon! I've emailed support and Tweeted at Chime, but no response. Don't use this app!!!"
1092,Chime is NOT a bank. It is NOT licensed or insured as a bank. Don't trust them. Lots of people have had their accounts locked with thousands of dollars on them. Not worth the risk. Better is to use Capital One or some other REAL bank.
1093,"The worst online banking. You can't get the app to work, you can't transfer funds online. Support can't help with any problem. They put your account on hold just about everyday. They say your deposits are up to two days early, it's the 10th of the month and my check has not been deposited yet. It's 12 days late. Don't use chime. Terrible, terrible online banking.."
1094,"Very dissatisfied. Told me that i couldn't open an account, but also told me that they couldn't tell me why I was denied. This was after I had put my personal and sensitive information in."
1095,"Chime is terrible They limit functionality intentionally. Banks shouldn't have a ""pro"" level needed to use banning services. The UI is 85% devoted to ads, and they hold fund transfers longer than they need to. Don't use Chime"
1096,To slow
1097,I got my cared to day my phone messed up delete the app I have to order a hole no card to be able to get on to start my card up a wast of time I re did it and that won't to send me a hole new card and says can't give my info to me I got ever thing not worth it wast of time thanks for wasting my time
1098,Won't allow me to open account and I literally have no previous banking issues anywhere. I have steady paying job. And it sucks cause I'd love to build credit cause I have none since I'm young. No matter what I try it says it's unable to.
1099,They never gave me my money back
1100,"I loved this card, then mine was stolen and they took two weeks to tell me my new one was lost in the mail and they couldn't send another one faster than a week. So for two weeks they've had my pay checks and now another week. They're customer service legit does not care at all about anyone."
1101,Can't download chime app to my cellphone. I don't what is the problem with the Websites
1102,Never received the text with the sign up link after multiple tries. Makes me not trust Chime's reliability.
1103,"These people stole $15,446 from me by closing my account for no real reason. The reason being that they are corrupt and engaging in thieft. DO NOT USE CHIME!"
1104,"The biggest scam ever, becarefull, chime is a big scam, if anything goes wrong with your account and you can prove that something went wrong, chime is not abilgated to give you anything back , they must side against you, that's how they make their money by ripping people off.."
1105,The lies they tell just get a real bank account and make sure you're adding up and checking your bank statements because I've found 2 errors where they tried to take my hard earned money
1106,Literally trash.
1107,Why do you guys keep on denying me I just dont get it you are losing people this way. I am in the USA born a US citizen and I am 18 years old have a bank account! I just dont get it what are the DAMN true requirements and I just recently open a new rcu bank account.
1108,"Very disappointed. The 4 free bank ATMs that were shown in my area when I signed up a few weeks ago apparently are no longer free. Now the only free ATMs in my area are out of the way and either in a high crime area or not 24hr which is not going to work since I work long hours. Oddly, according to the app description in play store (and not the in app map), the ATM that charged me, should still be free. Sadly, I didn't notice the maps had been changed until after I needed an ATM in a hurry."
1109,First thing I got to say the app makes you put all your info in without explaining any terms and conditions and then at end says enter social security number .nope. that's when I stopped application default a deal breaker for me ..no way
1110,This is absolutely the worst app. They kept my check for DAYS after it was posted. Ill never use this app again.
1111,"The reason I even sign up for chime is because you guys claimed I'll get paid 2 days before if I sign up for direct deposit, that was a lie, you also said you would spot me up to 200 dollars if I get direct deposit that's was also a lie"
1112,Its a very hard thing trying to even reset my password for the spot me with my chime acct i need help please reset my password
1113,Seeing I've tried making an account a few times and get a vague message about they're team is declining me for an unknown reason then when I try to email them (which is the only point of contact they have) and there server blocks it so until they make it possible to contact them and actually be somewhat useful this app is trash
1114,This app is horrible. My account was hacked and someone took my phone number and email off my account. I cant get into my account. And chime wont let me set up another account. This is crazy
1115,CHIMe stole my money and closed my account. Do not use.
1116,"Terrible, slow, can't verify anything. No support. Doesn't recognize accounts."
1117,Took 300 dollars and never gave it back kept blaming it on the atm
1118,If I could give this app negive stars I would this is the worst bank I have ever banker with tried call customer support and they hung up on me they have been closing accounts for no reason do not use
1119,"This is not a bank, that is disingenuous. Beware. Scammy."
1120,"I had this card and they told me my account was closed and the money I had on the card I lost. $1** down the drain. They told me that I was found to be not in compliance with Chime's internal policies and your account agreement, but they can't tell me which one I didn't comply with. Don't get this card it's a SCAM!!!!!"
1121,Worse app & customer service. I would never recomend. I just called customer service & instead getting help they choose to hang up. Even calling customer service sucks!!!!
1122,"Why did they change the ATMs, now there's only one arm near and only multiples of 20."
1123,Not a bank. Will steal your money.
1124,I downloaded and installed this app. I got a card sent to me. I set up the card. Two weeks go by and I go to login and besides said my service had been canceled. No explanation whatsoever period trying to get something from them is impossible. Told nothing useful at all. And not even able to sign up again. Complete trash.
1125,"I was looking forward on using this app. I entered all my information required and at the end, they lost it and could not create an account so they wanted me to send them the info again by email. If I already uploaded my info, where did it go? Be careful about this app."
1126,"Read the EULA! They can close your account any time, for any reason, and without notice...and they do! They currently have about 1000 complaints with the CFPB. Chime is a very loosely regulated neobank, it is NOT a bank, you have no FDIC protection! Consider yourself warned!"
1127,Worst bank ever
1128,Scamming bank. Give people's money back if you are closing the accounts or there will be a lawsuit!
1129,The worst banking app I've ever encountered. Truly Horrible!!!
1130,"I can't even open an account and they won't give me any reasons to why. Everytime I try to sign up I instantly get take to another webpage that's says ""sorry, you are unable to open an account"" and that's all."
1131,Worst customer service. I needed to change my phone number to my new number and cant because they need to send a code to my old one. What a joke.
1132,Chime does not recognize my address
1133,None of my contacts are showing under the friends section.
1134,***Stole my $$$$ Closed my account without reason and with $2500 having just been deposited. Recieved a check for $100*** want my $$$ Chime!!!!
1135,This is the worst i got ripped off and chime does not wana do amything about it i regret getting this mobile banking better off at a real bank not a 3rd party piece of s******
1136,Locked out my account reset my password still was unsucessful now locked out for an hour and support sugguested i continue to wait like i havent been the last 4hrs Itll be nice to have some actual aid to this matter
1137,The App will not download at all. Bad performance for a banking Application. Needs some serious work.
1138,"Be sure to read the ProPublica exposé on Chime before you consider giving them your money. Chime closed my account for no reason and refused to say why. Never answered any of my support emails. They've done the same to thousands of others and have stolen paychecks, stimulus payments, and more. Chime is just another big bank abusing customers that don't know any better, and then lying to people pretending to be on their side."
1139,Not even 5 seconds into the introduction and this app is worthless
1140,Who came up with this STUPID PUZZLE to get into your OWN account !!! Im pissed! Now i cant access my money like you dont kno who i am! Long as i have my email and password and 4 pin whats the problem !
1141,I thought I made a transfer to friends without a chime account that went to someone else. Dispute and rebuttal denied. My account has been frozen and suspended. Now my direct deposit has not been credited. The government says it was deposited on the 2nd. They want me to wait for 3 business days to do something. I have had this account 1 year. It has cost me my credit score and so much more from payments not gone through even though they said it did.
1142,If you log out of you're account before updating to You're New current phone number then you're unfortunately pretty much screwed ☹️
1143,Worst bank ever the first two deposits posted normal then a holiday leaves us without our money For days
1144,please
1145,Won't let me get an account
1146,I've had nothing but problems with this bank.
1147,Log in and delays
1148,Worst app I've ever dealt with. Everytime I try to do anything I have to call them. Total trash
1149,"Scammers. Stole my money and locked my account since last year. They promised to send me a check, but I never got it. Scammers 😠"
1150,Closed my account because of a claim they later rescinded took me 45 days to get my money back
1151,Horrible customer service. It's very clear from my experience and the thousands of BBB complaints they have that they do not care about their customers.
1152,It has bad customer service; they don't take due diligence to resolve unauthorized charges; I had a problem with them returning money on a dispute I was correct on they credit my account then took it off and made me wait more time and starve through the winter watch in Texas I called and was irate because how they handled the situation then they closed and banned my account be careful because they will try to steal your money
1153,Doesnt listen I had a dispute with multiple charges after my phone being stolen and they denied my claim now my account is negative and I will keep it that way I'm not paying for someone else taking my money I will just let the account close or whatever who punishes someone for there no ey being taken and then tries to rob them again pretty much
1154,"Can't get a good picture of my I.D from the web app, so i try the app. Now they refuse to make an account"
1155,Secure credit card is a scam. Not just a credit reporting debit card. You have to put in a varying certain amount each month.
1156,Tried to get an account with them and they said I could not and that was all. Nothing else to say?
1157,Our stuff got hacked and now Our replacement card is lost. Been a week since it was supposed to have been here.
1158,Horrible and stole money from me without getting back with me about a return there is an article on the unprofessionalism of chime and every statement is true
1159,Wasn't approved
1160,"Chime is not a bank. They are a scam. They reserve the right to steal your money in their fine print. If you get unemployment or tax returns they automaticaly assume it is fraud. Check the BBB, Chime is a scam. If you use expect your money to be stolen."
1161,WORSE MOBILE BANKING EVER!!! 🤬
1162,It sucks
1163,Unable to open an account and didn't even bother to give me an explanation. Garbage
1164,"This used to be my favorite banking app. However, 2 months ago, my app quit allowing me to log in. I can log in just fine through Google but not the app. Customer service is no help. All they do is tell me to reset my password and close my ticket. I know my password! The chime APP will not work on my phone now."
1165,I havent received my $75 yet n its well ova 45 days. Ive had problems gettn n my card lately. N i beleive its jus a buncha talk about $75 or even the $200 i havent received yet. Or should i say we meaning the person that turned me on to chime n signed me up for the account. Wat do i need to do to get my money. Or how can i open a account
1166,"Garbage, I took clear pictures of my license 4 times and can't verify...."
1167,THREE TIMES I have referred people and had them set up DD and use my link and EVERYTIME they tell me that I am lying and NO ONE HAS EVER CLICKED ON ANY OF MY REFERAL LINKS. I have filed with the Better Business Buero and unless they give me AT THE VERY LEAST the referral that was just completed I WILL be pressing charges and receiving compensation for them SCAMMING me out of money that was promised and lying about it. Im over with these cards getting people to sponser them for free.
1168,I used this app for years and loved it. recently it comes disconnected from my bank at least once a week and doesn't save money while it's disconnected. customer support took weeks to get back to me. I hate that the app changed so much because I used to really love it but I'll be cancelling my membership.
1169,"Was a super awesome app for quite some time. I throughly enjoyed it until it stopped saving me money just in general. The app says there is a bank connection issue, but won't allow me to contact anyone, change anything, nothing at all... so, my money has just been sitting dormant for months. Not to mention nothing with my bank has changed. It will still let me withdraw to my same account, still gives me my saving bonus, so what's the real issue?!?!"
1170,"For some reason the app disconnected from my bank. When I tried to reconnect my bank it said there was a connection issue and for me try again, I tried this multiple times with no luck. Then I thought to change my digit password but now it's telling me my password is incorrect. Closed the app, opened the app back up and it's not even loading now! I emailed Digit almost two weeks ago with no response. Very disappointed."
1171,I just installed this app and entered my Banks log in information and the app crashed. I clicked on it a second time and it asked me to link my bank. Each time it would link and tell me it was a success then crash. This isn't what I expected and I'm uninstalling.
1172,"I just downloaded this app. I set up my bank account to link. After it shows it's been linked successfully I press ""Continue"" and it force quits me out of the app. Then when I reopen the app it prompts me to add my bank account again. It's just making me go around in circles and it doesn't give me access to anything else on the app."
1173,"I loved the app at first, now all I have are connection issues. It's just annoying now. I reached out to customer service and they were no help. They have an ""oh well, sorry about your luck"" attitude. Hopefully they can get the glitches fixed one day, but for now, I'm closing my account."
1174,"Won't let me withdraw, says because of unusual activity. After trying multiple times I finally got an answer from someone at digit.... only to complicate things further. I tried to close my account and again doesn't let me do that. But hey... they keep billing me 5 dollars a month. This is a worthless app with no support for customers and its stealing my money!"
1175,I'm dropping my rating from 5 stars to 1 star. Bring back the credit card payoff feature and the cell phone bill payment feature. Those were reasons why I PAID for this app...not for you to take features away to leave me with less...
1176,"I was loving it, but now the app isn't working. It's not saving my money, and I can't even see it on the app. I'm very disappointed. Hopefully the problem is fixed soon. I've uninstalled and installed still nothing."
1177,"Accidentally deleted last review. This app is a scam. I first posted in May, the 8th to be exact, that i have been trying to get my money back since Dec 2017. They (Digit) left a response like on everyone elses to email them. Not only had i already done that but I did it again. It is not July of 2021 and still no response. I just emaileed them again today. The account used is no longer open and when you try to confirm your identity, if you mess up, oh well. Bye money. You only get one chance."
1178,"Had to reconnect with bank way too often,got sick and tired of it, withdrawing all funds and closing account soon."
1179,"When I logged successfully into my bank, then it kicked me out as if I never did it at all. Over and over I tried and I just didn't trust this app anymore."
1180,Not happy with this app at all. Too hard for me to estimate what they're taking out of my bank account everyday! Great big thumbs down!
1181,Its annoying and you can't stop them from taking money out of your account they just keep taking it out and when you go to withdrawal they make you do it $2 by $1 by $2 even if you have $22 period is so annoying and stressful
1182,Started okay. But when I set limits and you go pass 3 times in one day messing up my bank account. I am good thanks though.
1183,"Does not let me use my phone number to sing up, my phone nuber is from Puerto Rico, i tried every way of arraging the numbers and it did not work. Help please..."
1184,"I downloaded this a couple of years ago, and rarely used it. It said it was free when I first downloaded it, but since this year (2021) I've been seeing $5.00 charges from Digit which I did not authorize, having not even used the app since at least 2019. I had to close the account to prevent further charges, not happy with Digit at all."
1185,"Not a fan of the app in general. I tried to cancel my account recently but I can't remember my password to confirm the cancellation. When I tried to reset my password, nothing happened. The text to verify my device never went thru and the link in the email kept saying that that link had already been used, even though I had not used it before, each time just following the link that popped up my the most recent email. Just let me close my account already.."
1186,"Okay going to rehash this review, I used digit for a few years now and just the savings feature it was great and the only thing they had when I got the app. Every feature they introduced passed that would never work it would fail to verify. The balance updates moving to app notifications and not working was the final straw. They offered me like 4 months of free services but it's just not worth it. Their support is terrible too."
1187,"Highest fee in the microsavings industry. Frequent bank account disconnection. Automatically logged me out, and when I opened the app to log back in, they had enabled push notifications, thus ending forever the daily text notifications I preferred. Then they blamed ME for having accidentally done it in the app. I never even OPENED the app until they logged me out. Complete trashing of a formerly good app. It's a shame."
1188,"Used to work great but it suddenly asked for my bank account info again, so I did and it just keeps looping back to link bank account to digit. I can not even look at any of my savings accounts on digit. Endless loop of reconnecting my bank account. I will.no longer be using this service."
1189,Hello again. Here we are over a year later. I've have recently sent a email to your company to close my account. (5) days ago I'm still awaiting your company to respond. Why was this never addressed. It is very sad that making a public review is the only way to contact you when you do not reply to my email!!! Very dissatisfied.
1190,"Puerto Rico Phone #. Can't even ""sign up"" since it doesnt recognize my Puerto Rico phone number."
1191,Horrible. They have all these hidden fees and it says it made a credit card payment for me and it never posted
1192,"All the changes they made its for their own benefit, I don't see any reason to continue working with digit. There are apps that do the same you do for ""free"" ( like digit, they use our money...) They increase the monthly fee, cut the bonus more than once... It's hard to believe  that this is  going  any further...."
1193,"Why did I waste my spare time thinking this app saves me money But takes $5.99 every Month? No cash advance, no loan options, it simply takes a couple dollars from your bank then tells you how to manage your money. 😐 GREAT APP!!!"
1194,"I've tried connecting my account 3 seperate times. Each time I verify and it states it was successful, once I hit continue it crashes and acts like nothing happened which then it makes me repeat the cycle. Really wanted to try this app out if I could get some help."
1195,"I've connected it to my bank 10+ times but after it says success, I click continue, then the app closes and I have to do it again."
1196,It would be great if it actually saved money. I haven't had a move from account in a week and it's money on my bank account. If this doesn't change soon I'm closing it
1197,It was awesome for a long time. Now it wont connect to my bank. Its been over 2 weeks.
1198,"Makes me go through the whole process of linking my account and when it says it has been linked, the app crashes. Waste of time"
1199,"Can't even use the app, it tells me I've successfully added my bank then immediately crashes when I press continue."
1200,I DO NOT have an acct w u yet u take $2.99$5.99and$.69 sporadically throughout every month for the past year. I've contacted their support and all I get back is an email stating they are closing my case for non response when they never sent a previous email to respond to. My bank finally succeeded in blocking them a few days ago and about an hour ago I get a notification with a direct debit payment of $2.99 to digit.co there is no way in heck you legally have a card number stop charging me.
1201,App won't open. Cannot access money even though it seems to be fine on the other end. Digit keeps taking more money and I have no way to get to it anymore.
1202,Crashing! I downloaded it and everytime after the bank information the app crashes and close..
1203,App keeps crashing when trying to connect bank. Can't use the app.
1204,I had already canceled my account and my daughters account over a year ago and I just noticed Digit is stealing from us. They keep on pulling money out of my account. 🤬🤬👎👎👎👎👎 be careful they steal money
1205,Even though I closed my account this is still withdrawing funds from my checking account
1206,Can't link any bank account with different banks listed in plaid
1207,"I got this app two years ago and was pretty sure I canceled it awhile back only to find I have been making payments every month. Just found out they were still charging me on an account I wasn't using, so now I have returned check fees costing me almost 100 dollars. When I talked to a bank costumer service rep, they said that they charged me a couple times and then raised the price when it wasn't going through."
1208,"Just installed Digit and as soon as it says my account is linked, the app crashes/closes. What gives? Just wanting my banking info, Digit?"
1209,Doesn't let you link your bank account even if you know that you are putting the correct username and password
1210,"It was so good at first. Used it for a couple of years. Then it disconnected from my bank and never let me reconnect it. I tried many things (unistalling, contacting customer support for them and my bank) and nothing. Such a shame it was so easy to use!"
1211,"Doesn't ever get past bank account. I attach my bank then it goes out of the app, then won't let me do anything because there is no bank account attached. Doesn't have one of my banks, or other cards. I have attached my bank with a success message 4 times, press continue then it goes to my home screen completely exiting the app. Go back into the app and it asks for my bank account again. Idea is great, but it doesn't work."
1212,"Does great at withdrawing money, but then locked me out of my account when I disconnected my bank account. I'm most upset that I saw a subscription fee being charged to my bank account and I NEVER signed up for a subscription. Will never use this app again."
1213,I used to love the app but they stopped letting you save for credit card and cell phone bills... I canceled my service... bring back the service DIGIT!!!
1214,"Digit didn't tell me about the subscription it forced me to get, digit ended up checking my wait till my bank account is at a certain amount box, digit isn't a good app in my opinion, you might think it is good, but It has a very big scam feel to it, do they take money from you when you go to the bank to get a savings account, no, they keep your money safe, not make you lose your money, you gain interest not lose it."
1215,Won't stay connected
1216,"The idea of this app is great but the actual app isn't. During a recent situation my account went negative. I set up my rainy day funds to be overdraft protection. The app deposited the rainy day funds then later withdrew more money than it deposited. This caused me to gain an overdraft fee. After I reached out, they said they'd reimbursed the overdraft fee but they're charging me to deposit the reimbursement into my account. We decided to cut ties and they wont refund the monthly fee."
1217,"So far so good. As long as it doesn't turn all SkyNet on me I'm good with it. What would make it better is providing a report on the spending analysis it does on your account. ......update after over a month of usage. Well again, I love the app but what is really starting to become VERY aggravating is the frequency this app is hitting my checking account. Please allow the user to control the ""frequency"" say per week or something. I pay all my bills through auto draft. Digit is hitting it alot."
1218,I cancelled my account and it still is withdrawing money from my account and was supposed to refund my money to me and instead it keeps taking money.
1219,"1 star is too nice! Garbage app always crashes, ALWAYS!! Have to reset password ALWAYS! I'd be able to get myself out of debt if I charged Digit by the number of times I've had to reset my password only to find that it won't even log me in! GARBAGE! SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!!!!!!!"
1220,Loved this app until recently it will not connect with my bank and now I have no way to get my money out. I contacted customer service and they said they were unable to assist me and didn't know why my bank could no longer connect. Please fix this as I've had the service for over a year and love it.
1221,"The app actually overdrafted my bank account to fund the ""rainy day fund"", thus incurring overdraft fees to my real checking account. Additionally, the withdrawals from my PNC checking account for the rainy day fund were pending for days and days and days, making the money completely inaccessible as it was stuck in pending limbo. Overall the app is not very user friendly, and I just don't like it. 1 star for the several $36 ea overdraft fees incurred by withdrawals from this app."
1222,"I kept getting these payments on my bank account from digit originally, wasn't told that they would start taking money out of my account right when I first started, I had to figure it out for why I was being charged and where it was going. I was also charged for a subscription that I didn't even want and I just want my money back from the subscription, it went through yesterday and I wasn't even informed about it."
1223,Loved the app until they kept raising the monthly fee. Not about to pay $60/year. Closed my account and deleted the app.
1224,"You put my account in overdraft, and I can take my money back , please refund my money, I don't want this app again, you put my account in négatif position , I just want my refunnnnnd"
1225,"Wouldn't connect to my bank account after several tries then unbeknownst to me the attempts got me locked out of my account, by the time I realized it because I tried to log in to make an important transfer it was too late in the evening to call my bank to resolve being locked out."
1226,"Pulled 60 dollars out of checking and overdrew my account, when I also have digit overdraw protection on! The morning text even showed that digit knew there was 40 dollars in there, and they did it anyway. Ridiculous. Never even let me know it happened, I just checked my bank account."
1227,I love the app but my bank disconnected and its been two weeks and it still won't connect. They said they had no way to fix it. Not happy about that response. It was really helping me save.
1228,Will take your only money you have left in your account. Closed/cancelled
1229,"Sneakily charges $5/month directly out of bank account. I would never have subscribed to a service like this, and I wasn't made aware of the charge until two months later when I saw a charge in my bank statement! Absolutely fraudulent to do this! BEWARE - THIS SERVICE COSTS $5/MONTH. People taking my money without asking first makes me mad!"
1230,"My bank is not even listed. There needs to be an option when choosing a bank from your extremely short list of banks 18 to be exact ""my bank not listed"" to be able to go on within the app."
1231,App is BS it should only take money when money is there but no digit takes money when it wants to. My account is in overdraft thanks to digit. It didn't just take money once but then tries again and agian. I have 5 overdraft fees thanoa to this dumb app.
1232,"Caused 2 overdrafts despite the fact that I had the overdraft protection feature turned on. I had a positive checking account balance and two Digit withdrawals put me in the negative costing me $70 in bank overdraft fees. The second withdrawal occurred when I had a negative checking account balance. You would think their software was smart enough to not withdraw on a negative balance. It's not, beware! I found out the hard way."
1233,It doesn't recognize acct linked to bank. App continues to ask to link Accts.
1234,I just installed the app and was very disappointed it crashed 3 times during the account set up. Needless to say I Uninstalled the app.
1235,I set the app up for withdrawals from my banking and now the app keeps closing within seconds of opening it. This need to be fixed especially when I cannot see where my money went.
1236,When I first got the app it was great I set it up forgot about it then I save a lot but some happened to where I had pull all the money now ever time I deleted and load the app it says can't connect to your account.
1237,"App doesn't work. When you try to reset your password, you don't get a text message or when you go to get email verification, it won't send password reset link..."
1238,"It lost track of my bank. It is designed to track your bank account total and save based on that amount, but when the app thinks you have $400.00 in the bank for 4 days in a row and in reality you only have $150.00. That is going to cause issues with your budget when $19.00 dollars is pulled for those days. Those numbers aren't exact, but you get the concept. Now im trying to replace the money. They charge for this. Plus $5 monthly. 1~2 day wait for help. More issues only 500 words allowed.-_-"
1239,"I really liked this app up until about a month ago. For some reason, Digit stopped saving in June. I figured it was because I had changed the nick name of my bank account. So I withdrew what I had and tried to reconnect my bank to Digit. The first screen said that my bank account was connected to Digit but when I got to the next screen, the message was Digit was having trouble connecting to my bank. This has been going on for over a month and still nothing has been fixed. The only response I get is ""oh I'm sorry we don't have an update from our data provider"". Nothing else to help reconnect. In my opinion, they don't care whether you're a customer or not. And for a company to only communicate through email is NOT helpful!!!!"
1240,"Please don't waste time I did trying get help with the App not working!! The feature for the credit card reduction doesn't work. When you try to accept the terms so you can begin using it, You get an error message telling you to retry entering your information or click for help that you never get a response for!! They are quick to get into your bank account and that's it. I have been trying to get help for 5 days now with no response."
1241,"GMA recommended this app to viewers who were trying to keep a budget and start a savings. I was excited because from what GMA said this was exactly what i was looming for. It wouks show me where my money was going. WELL my bank is not one of the banks it can connect to. Very dissapointed in the app because my bank is not a local bank its a bank well established in Texas. Second in GMA, i would have thought they woukd have made sure it was avaioble nationally."
1242,"It Charged me without permission. It doesnt say in description, just a code. I thought i can save money on this app but it charge automatically $6.51 and $0.61. I know its a small amount but this app doesnt service me at all and still charge me. I spend money on this app rather than save. Uninstall it. Disappointed."
1243,"RUN A AWAY FROM THIS APP AND NEVER LOOK BACK! THIS HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE! At 1st I loved it . But all if a sudden the app froze and would not let me into my account, but it was still taking my money. There is not a phone number listed only email for customer service. After several attempts to contact customer service nothing has happened. My money is gone. I had to call my bank and pay for a stop order on my account."
1244,"Did not enjoy whatsoever. Really easy to set up but had no indication that they would be withdrawing a fee. Isnt the whole point of the app to help you save money??!! Even after removing the app and phone number, it kept withdrawing a fee which put my account on overdraft. I just found out how to finally close it after a week on trying to figure out how to remove this abomination of an app. Yeah, no thanks, I'm going to stick to saving money my own way."
1245,"I loved this app when I first started using it, but have since deleted it and closed the account. The delay between the banks and the app caused me to have over $300 worth of overdraft fees!!! The overdraft protection does not work due to how long it takes to return funds to your bank. It also does not account for pending transactions, it takes money based on your present balance, not your balance after the pending transactions. It is better to just save money through your bank."
1246,Thought this was an excellent app to save money without thinking about it. I checked this morning and digit caused 3 overdraft fees to occur in my account. I've closed my account and I'm pretty frustrated that the app caused me to lose money instead of saving like it's supposed to. Word of advice to anyone wanting to use this app. Dont let whatever account you're using get under $100
1247,"Their customer service is horrible. No person to talk too, having to rely on email service, they'll close your request without helping. I have $200 in the digit account that is still pending even though it should be finally transferred today. I tried to withdraw my money and gave me an error message. They also charge you a $5 subscription fee. DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! IT'S A FRAUD!!! Edit: They're quick to respond here yet haven't answered my emails since two weeks ago."
1248,"Beware, if you need to cancel they make it hard(takes 90 days blablabla) .They've continued to withdraw money from my account, after I cancelled. I had my bank block them, but now they've charged me $5 for the ""subscription"" with a similar vendor name, which is how they circumvent the block. Essentially they've no respect for you or your money. I'm going to get a new bank account, I'm sure they'll do their best to continue charging my account since they have my information."
1249,"The help center is not very helpful. After emailing them multiple times, no one even tried to help resolve the connection issue with my bank. The last time I emailed them they said someone would get back to me in a couple days. After ten days I never heard back. I was charged twice for access to the app while the app never saved any money during that time. The last email I sent about closing the account said they would refund my money. I have not received the refund yet."
1250,This was great at first. Then it started pulling money out for the monthly charges but said it couldn't connect to my account to withdraw money for savings. This didn't make sense since it's all the same account. I deleted it once i discovered this. Not trustworthy in my opionion. Update...... Ok. I had closed my account through the app and guess what. Still took out the fee for this month. UPDATE this has been resolved sufficiently. Returned the fees.
1251,"Please do not use this app!!! The app started malfunctioning after a previous update. Even after the most recent update, I cannot see any of the information on the screen, and therefore am unable to edit or withdraw it pause funds! I have been emailing back and forth with support for weeks, and the only response i get is them asking over and over again for screenshots of what I'm seeing! I have no doubt I'll never see my savings again."
1252,"I'm super disappointed in the customer service. There was an offer at the bottom of my page ""get x amount of people to sign up by this day and receive $250"" well, I did that. Guess what I didn't get? My money. I emailed and they said ""digit doesn't save on the weekends or holidays. So you only get paid once they've had their first automatic save. Conveniently they offered this on a Thursday. Right before the weekend and xmas eve and day. deadline was Christmas. very misleading. uninstalling."
1253,"if I could write negative Stars I would. Downloaded without reading the reviews first. Had a minimal amount of money saved, thank goodness. I saw on Facebook that when you request money you get it within 30 minutes or less. requested my money. I waited. And waited. It's been over a week and I have yet to receive that money back. I canceled my account on Friday. Today I wake up and look at my bank account and there is a pending charge into my savings. long story short, do not use this app."
1254,"I've had this app for a few years, and really enjoyed it until recently. Now, every single time I open the app it is blank. It gives me zero information whatsoever, and since I know theres a payment now, I find it extremely annoying that the app isn't functional. I am unable to see how much money I have saved, and I am also unable to transfer anything. So, theres literally no point to having it"
1255,"Lousy AI system. The formula in itself sounds great. It looks at your spending habits and moves small amounts of money. However, while I processed my rent, digit decided to yank out a large amount out, causing my rent to bounce. I haven't had the app for a month yet, so it didn't know my algorithm of payments yet. Now I'm going to be hit with a late fee, because it takes a few days to move that money back. Glad i was still in the trial period, because I have now disconnected my accounts."
1256,"It was very useful, AT FIRST. I thought ""wow, Im saving so much!"" Then for some reason digit wouldnt update my account balance causing overdrafts, even with overdraft protection on. It continued to take money from my account without letting me know. I opted for the msg updates and didnt get anything regarding how much money was being transferred like I had in the first couple of weeks. Seems unstable and too risky for me."
1257,"After I found out there was a fee. I wanted to cancel but it literally isn't giving me the option to due to trail period not being up. It said it would take money every few days, but with drew daily from my account making it difficult to balance personal finance. This app is those with a decent amount of extra cash and that's not me this actually hindered my budget."
1258,This app is absolutely ridiculous. It does not help with saving anything. I had the over draft protection on and it still took my account negative. Not only that there's a $30 saving fee that it takes out every time it transfers money out of my account. And no that $30 doesn't go into any of my savings. What kind of bs is this? This deactivated this app but it still took money out and it supposed to put my funds back in which didn't happen. Save yourself the headache. Dont download this app
1259,"The ads on Snapchat say that I can just message digit and see if I can afford something. Not only that but the ads show that I could set up a budget. There is no option to do this. When I tried texting digit it had no idea what I was talking about. You guys should check out the app ""Cleo"" on Facebook and see what they're doing right. Also, in 1 month they saved me $0.42. Waste of time and money."
1260,"The first week I had the App I received 2 $24 overdraft fees days apart. I requested a reimbursement for one of the overdrafts and was reimbursed. ""Cool."" But the last straw came this week when I realized I was being charged a ""secret"" $2.99 subscription fee that was disguised to look like an ""auto-savings"" but this time it caused an overdraft. So for the last 3 months they charged me a $3 fee but never actually ""saved"" a dime. The ""Daily Low balance"" feature only works in Theory. No Bueno!!"
1261,"I've tried numerous times to close my acct and it's like a never-ending loop. I go to one link which sends me to another and the while process repeats. It tells me that they're having trouble. I keep getting messages that I've tried to stop, but they keep coming. I tried to chamge my bamk info. It wont let me. Its like a nigtmare. I just want to be done. I tries it and i don't like it. Just let me go already!!😠"
1262,Tried using this to have a joint savings account so me and my friend could put money towards a goal. My friend started an account and added me so we could save together. For some reason it gives the second party the ability to see the other persons checking like their actual checking acc. and spending habits which was awkward and not what we wanted. I contacted tech support to get my password reset and never got a reply to my question after several days. Would have been nice to know how joint accounts work during the set-up process.
1263,"Horrible company, don't do it! I've tried deactivating my account over 5 times now. I get the confirmation screen it's no longer active, then they continue to take the monthly subscription out of my account. They have no real customer service just a scam email so speaking to someone to get your issues taken care of is impossible. I'm going to have to report them as fraudulent charges to stop the money from coming out of my account."
1264,It's always a few days behind so itll take money out of your account in larger quantities if it thinks you have more. Which is a faulty system because then the actual withdraw goes through a few days later without your knowledge and could overdraft you. They also have a policy of only 2 reimbursements caused by the app. This is my second time trying it out and I can honestly say it's just not worth it. It causes more problems than it should. A good ole savings account is all you need trust me
1265,"we wanted to love this app, and for the first few days, we did, but this morning I woke up in our account was overdrawn almost $100, and come to find out it was because digit tried pulling money from our account that was already negative, so we got hit with three return check fees, luckily my bank is amazing was able to fix that, but I'm extremely displeased because it knows how much money is in your account, and still pulled out money, and it's definitely screwed us over we'll never use again!!"
1266,"I've been using this app for about 2 months now and it has saved me quite a bit of money I wouldn't be able to do on my own. With that being said, I only gave it 1 star due to their horrible help center. I had funds automatically transfer on January 28. It is now February 5 and those funds are still not in my account. Help center has not responded to my multiple emails and now I am out almost $250! Once this is resolved I will be closing my Digit account."
1267,"I have downloaded, undownloaded, and downloaded again trying to get my account to connect. It says that it has successfully connected and then gives me an error everytime I finish the process of connecting my bank account. I have done this several times now and it is exhausting. I was really looking forward to using this app to help save money, but it looks like very unlikely to happen. Super disappointed with this app. I'll be using a different one."
1268,I tried to set up my account at least 20 times I gave up and uninstalled.
1269,Hadn't used it for a while. I'm trying to use it now and I keep getting a message that says network error. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and I'm getting the same thing. Update: A whole year later and every other day I get a message saying my bank account has been disconnected. Gives me hacker vibes. I will be canceling my service.
1270,Started okay. But when I set limits and you go pass 3 times in one day messing up my bank account. I am good thanks though.
1271,I just installed this app and entered my Banks log in information and the app crashed. I clicked on it a second time and it asked me to link my bank. Each time it would link and tell me it was a success then crash. This isn't what I expected and I'm uninstalling.
1272,Won't stay connected
1273,"It was so good at first. Used it for a couple of years. Then it disconnected from my bank and never let me reconnect it. I tried many things (unistalling, contacting customer support for them and my bank) and nothing. Such a shame it was so easy to use!"
1274,"Accidentally deleted last review. This app is a scam. I first posted in May, the 8th to be exact, that i have been trying to get my money back since Dec 2017. They (Digit) left a response like on everyone elses to email them. Not only had i already done that but I did it again. It is not July of 2021 and still no response. I just emaileed them again today. The account used is no longer open and when you try to confirm your identity, if you mess up, oh well. Bye money. You only get one chance."
1275,"I got this app two years ago and was pretty sure I canceled it awhile back only to find I have been making payments every month. Just found out they were still charging me on an account I wasn't using, so now I have returned check fees costing me almost 100 dollars. When I talked to a bank costumer service rep, they said that they charged me a couple times and then raised the price when it wasn't going through."
1276,"I loved the app at first, now all I have are connection issues. It's just annoying now. I reached out to customer service and they were no help. They have an ""oh well, sorry about your luck"" attitude. Hopefully they can get the glitches fixed one day, but for now, I'm closing my account."
1277,Can't link any bank account with different banks listed in plaid
1278,Randomly stopped working and now I'm out of cash
1279,"I can put in account info, because its stuck on old bank account info"
1280,I used this app for years and loved it. recently it comes disconnected from my bank at least once a week and doesn't save money while it's disconnected. customer support took weeks to get back to me. I hate that the app changed so much because I used to really love it but I'll be cancelling my membership.
1281,How do I cancel so I stop getting charged $5 a month?
1282,Poor was doing good and then just disconnected from my bank and haven't been able to get back on
1283,Doesn't let you link your bank account even if you know that you are putting the correct username and password
1284,"Had to reconnect with bank way too often,got sick and tired of it, withdrawing all funds and closing account soon."
1285,"I just downloaded this app. I set up my bank account to link. After it shows it's been linked successfully I press ""Continue"" and it force quits me out of the app. Then when I reopen the app it prompts me to add my bank account again. It's just making me go around in circles and it doesn't give me access to anything else on the app."
1286,Even though I closed my account this is still withdrawing funds from my checking account
1287,"I was loving it, but now the app isn't working. It's not saving my money, and I can't even see it on the app. I'm very disappointed. Hopefully the problem is fixed soon. I've uninstalled and installed still nothing."
1288,"For some reason the app disconnected from my bank. When I tried to reconnect my bank it said there was a connection issue and for me try again, I tried this multiple times with no luck. Then I thought to change my digit password but now it's telling me my password is incorrect. Closed the app, opened the app back up and it's not even loading now! I emailed Digit almost two weeks ago with no response. Very disappointed."
1289,I'm dropping my rating from 5 stars to 1 star. Bring back the credit card payoff feature and the cell phone bill payment feature. Those were reasons why I PAID for this app...not for you to take features away to leave me with less...
1290,"Does not let me use my phone number to sing up, my phone nuber is from Puerto Rico, i tried every way of arraging the numbers and it did not work. Help please..."
1291,"When I logged successfully into my bank, then it kicked me out as if I never did it at all. Over and over I tried and I just didn't trust this app anymore."
1292,I used to love the app but they stopped letting you save for credit card and cell phone bills... I canceled my service... bring back the service DIGIT!!!
1293,My bank account details? I thought it was a kind of a budget planner. Are there people that can trust these sensitive information to an app.?
1294,I'm trying to close my account and I can't
1295,"Was a super awesome app for quite some time. I throughly enjoyed it until it stopped saving me money just in general. The app says there is a bank connection issue, but won't allow me to contact anyone, change anything, nothing at all... so, my money has just been sitting dormant for months. Not to mention nothing with my bank has changed. It will still let me withdraw to my same account, still gives me my saving bonus, so what's the real issue?!?!"
1296,Not happy with this app at all. Too hard for me to estimate what they're taking out of my bank account everyday! Great big thumbs down!
1297,I canceled this app mths ago and its still charging my acct.
1298,Horrible. They have all these hidden fees and it says it made a credit card payment for me and it never posted
1299,"Puerto Rico Phone #. Can't even ""sign up"" since it doesnt recognize my Puerto Rico phone number."
1300,"Won't let me withdraw, says because of unusual activity. After trying multiple times I finally got an answer from someone at digit.... only to complicate things further. I tried to close my account and again doesn't let me do that. But hey... they keep billing me 5 dollars a month. This is a worthless app with no support for customers and its stealing my money!"
1301,Fees have risen.
1302,Its annoying and you can't stop them from taking money out of your account they just keep taking it out and when you go to withdrawal they make you do it $2 by $1 by $2 even if you have $22 period is so annoying and stressful
1303,Will take your only money you have left in your account. Closed/cancelled
1304,It would be great if it actually saved money. I haven't had a move from account in a week and it's money on my bank account. If this doesn't change soon I'm closing it
1305,Loved the app until they kept raising the monthly fee. Not about to pay $60/year. Closed my account and deleted the app.
1306,I have never used this app yet it says that my number is already in the system
1307,Overdraft Fees
1308,"Can't even use the app, it tells me I've successfully added my bank then immediately crashes when I press continue."
1309,"Makes me go through the whole process of linking my account and when it says it has been linked, the app crashes. Waste of time"
1310,"I love it!! I never miss the money it takes. 5/5/21... I've been using this digit app for years, up until five days ago it's been great. Now all the sudden I have absolutely no access to my money or what's going on with the digit account itself. I have tried numerous times to contact them and it's very frustrating that there is no actual phone number to speak to a human and try and work it out. I have uninstalled and reinstalled this at multiple times and nothing is helping"
1311,I had already canceled my account and my daughters account over a year ago and I just noticed Digit is stealing from us. They keep on pulling money out of my account. 🤬🤬👎👎👎👎👎 be careful they steal money
1312,"Okay going to rehash this review, I used digit for a few years now and just the savings feature it was great and the only thing they had when I got the app. Every feature they introduced passed that would never work it would fail to verify. The balance updates moving to app notifications and not working was the final straw. They offered me like 4 months of free services but it's just not worth it. Their support is terrible too."
1313,"I've connected it to my bank 10+ times but after it says success, I click continue, then the app closes and I have to do it again."
1314,Won't let me add my bank. Go through the whole process. Says success. Closes out. Wants me to start over with adding my bank.
1315,"Highest fee in the microsavings industry. Frequent bank account disconnection. Automatically logged me out, and when I opened the app to log back in, they had enabled push notifications, thus ending forever the daily text notifications I preferred. Then they blamed ME for having accidentally done it in the app. I never even OPENED the app until they logged me out. Complete trashing of a formerly good app. It's a shame."
1316,If I could give 0 or negative 5 starts i would. they took 5 bucks without my pomission and I AM NOT VERY HAPPY WIT IT!!!! Do not trust this app unless u are goiNg to messed up your bank account.
1317,"Used to work great but it suddenly asked for my bank account info again, so I did and it just keeps looping back to link bank account to digit. I can not even look at any of my savings accounts on digit. Endless loop of reconnecting my bank account. I will.no longer be using this service."
1318,Scam? Keeps having me link bank account over and over. Can't even cancel account
1319,"Why did I waste my spare time thinking this app saves me money But takes $5.99 every Month? No cash advance, no loan options, it simply takes a couple dollars from your bank then tells you how to manage your money. 😐 GREAT APP!!!"
1320,"I downloaded this a couple of years ago, and rarely used it. It said it was free when I first downloaded it, but since this year (2021) I've been seeing $5.00 charges from Digit which I did not authorize, having not even used the app since at least 2019. I had to close the account to prevent further charges, not happy with Digit at all."
1321,"Just installed Digit and as soon as it says my account is linked, the app crashes/closes. What gives? Just wanting my banking info, Digit?"
1322,I just installed the app and was very disappointed it crashed 3 times during the account set up. Needless to say I Uninstalled the app.
1323,It was awesome for a long time. Now it wont connect to my bank. Its been over 2 weeks.
1324,Hello again. Here we are over a year later. I've have recently sent a email to your company to close my account. (5) days ago I'm still awaiting your company to respond. Why was this never addressed. It is very sad that making a public review is the only way to contact you when you do not reply to my email!!! Very dissatisfied.
1325,"Not a fan of the app in general. I tried to cancel my account recently but I can't remember my password to confirm the cancellation. When I tried to reset my password, nothing happened. The text to verify my device never went thru and the link in the email kept saying that that link had already been used, even though I had not used it before, each time just following the link that popped up my the most recent email. Just let me close my account already.."
1326,"Doesn't ever get past bank account. I attach my bank then it goes out of the app, then won't let me do anything because there is no bank account attached. Doesn't have one of my banks, or other cards. I have attached my bank with a success message 4 times, press continue then it goes to my home screen completely exiting the app. Go back into the app and it asks for my bank account again. Idea is great, but it doesn't work."
1327,U cannot speak to anyone. U cannot see your account and u cannot stop it. This is horrible. U cannot even figure out when they take your money. They have access to your account and there's nothing u can do abt it apparently
1328,"Does great at withdrawing money, but then locked me out of my account when I disconnected my bank account. I'm most upset that I saw a subscription fee being charged to my bank account and I NEVER signed up for a subscription. Will never use this app again."
1329,App is BS it should only take money when money is there but no digit takes money when it wants to. My account is in overdraft thanks to digit. It didn't just take money once but then tries again and agian. I have 5 overdraft fees thanoa to this dumb app.
1330,DO NOT INSTALL!!!!! Horrible app. Will over draw your account and leave u in debt. DO NOT INSTALL!!!!!
1331,Not worth the money
1332,Crashing! I downloaded it and everytime after the bank information the app crashes and close..
1333,"It withdraws money fast. However, when I needed the money I can't seem to get it back quickly. Plus, when I was trying to get the money back, it showed me reduced amount ."
1334,Close to $40 has been withdrawn from my bank account for a digit account that is supposed to be closed. It's hard to get ahold of these people.
1335,"I've tried connecting my account 3 seperate times. Each time I verify and it states it was successful, once I hit continue it crashes and acts like nothing happened which then it makes me repeat the cycle. Really wanted to try this app out if I could get some help."
1336,"All the changes they made its for their own benefit, I don't see any reason to continue working with digit. There are apps that do the same you do for ""free"" ( like digit, they use our money...) They increase the monthly fee, cut the bonus more than once... It's hard to believe  that this is  going  any further...."
1337,App keeps crashing when trying to connect bank. Can't use the app.
1338,"You put my account in overdraft, and I can take my money back , please refund my money, I don't want this app again, you put my account in négatif position , I just want my refunnnnnd"
1339,"I have canceled my subscription, but they are still taking out the fee they charge to have this app. Calling my bank today!"
1340,Very difficult to set up. Keeps saying my email and phone number already in use. I'm disgusted in the whole thing!
1341,I do not like the fact that it takes 3 days to hit my account
1342,Cancel ❌ and refund me my funds.
1343,"Digit didn't tell me about the subscription it forced me to get, digit ended up checking my wait till my bank account is at a certain amount box, digit isn't a good app in my opinion, you might think it is good, but It has a very big scam feel to it, do they take money from you when you go to the bank to get a savings account, no, they keep your money safe, not make you lose your money, you gain interest not lose it."
1344,App won't open. Cannot access money even though it seems to be fine on the other end. Digit keeps taking more money and I have no way to get to it anymore.
1345,It doesn't recognize acct linked to bank. App continues to ask to link Accts.
1346,Would not link with my credit union.
1347,Not able to login
1348,Will overdraft your account despite the limits you set
1349,I tried to cancel my subscription but it's still taking my $5 out of my account even after I cancel the subscription not sure on how to stop the $5 from coming out your account after you cancel your subscription
1350,I cancelled my account and it still is withdrawing money from my account and was supposed to refund my money to me and instead it keeps taking money.
1351,"Sneakily charges $5/month directly out of bank account. I would never have subscribed to a service like this, and I wasn't made aware of the charge until two months later when I saw a charge in my bank statement! Absolutely fraudulent to do this! BEWARE - THIS SERVICE COSTS $5/MONTH. People taking my money without asking first makes me mad!"
1352,THEY DON'T ACCEPT PNC BANK SMH...
1353,"I kept getting these payments on my bank account from digit originally, wasn't told that they would start taking money out of my account right when I first started, I had to figure it out for why I was being charged and where it was going. I was also charged for a subscription that I didn't even want and I just want my money back from the subscription, it went through yesterday and I wasn't even informed about it."
1354,"They take money from your account when you withdraw without sending the money you withdraw. For ex. They say ""you can withdraw 6.99 but it will cost you 1 dollar"" - they take from your account 6.99 and 1 dollar. Careful with this app!!"
1355,Will not connect with my bank
1356,When you are done with the app you are not allow to delete your account and they still take money out of your bank
1357,So far I can't sign into my digit account since It won't let me change my password. If this gets updated then I will consider changing my rate
1358,I DO NOT have an acct w u yet u take $2.99$5.99and$.69 sporadically throughout every month for the past year. I've contacted their support and all I get back is an email stating they are closing my case for non response when they never sent a previous email to respond to. My bank finally succeeded in blocking them a few days ago and about an hour ago I get a notification with a direct debit payment of $2.99 to digit.co there is no way in heck you legally have a card number stop charging me.
1359,Waste off time
1360,I used to have digit but I have unsubscribed already for the past 3 months and they still are charging me 5 dollars like why !? 😠
1361,"""We're unable to verify your identity att his time"" when using the credit card pay off feature. What does that mean?"
1362,Edit( App is terrible) wouldn't save money like I wanted it to.. kept saving .15.10 and .1 and .01 cents...and I had it at max for 5.00 nd 4.00 and 6.00 for all my goals and I have overr 2 thousand in my bank and set up to not take money if it falls below 750.00 so idk what happened..... It started out good and went down hill.... So I closed account...
1363,"The idea of this app is great but the actual app isn't. During a recent situation my account went negative. I set up my rainy day funds to be overdraft protection. The app deposited the rainy day funds then later withdrew more money than it deposited. This caused me to gain an overdraft fee. After I reached out, they said they'd reimbursed the overdraft fee but they're charging me to deposit the reimbursement into my account. We decided to cut ties and they wont refund the monthly fee."
1364,"Caused 2 overdrafts despite the fact that I had the overdraft protection feature turned on. I had a positive checking account balance and two Digit withdrawals put me in the negative costing me $70 in bank overdraft fees. The second withdrawal occurred when I had a negative checking account balance. You would think their software was smart enough to not withdraw on a negative balance. It's not, beware! I found out the hard way."
1365,"1)- I don't see my money when you guys take it from. 2)- When I need to withdraw the money that I save you don't let me to take the quantity that I want. 3)- I want to stop it, but I can't find anywhere to go for that. Please I to leave, help me!!!"
1366,"So, why did you guys charge me when I dont even have you installed. Should I go to the bank? Police? Please let me know !"
1367,When I first got the app it was great I set it up forgot about it then I save a lot but some happened to where I had pull all the money now ever time I deleted and load the app it says can't connect to your account.
1368,"I have had no issues so far... **** Came back to give one star. I have never had so much trouble with one of these advance apps. Every single week since I've had this app, as soon as I pay back my advance a glitch happens and it says I don't qualify because I have $0 in the bank, even though I have well over $100 in there at the time. I've had to text customer service for help every week.And it takes me 3 days of going back and forth this app sucks 😤 no problems w/ Brigit. Use them instead....."
1369,"Worst customer service ever!! The app was great until recently when I lost my job. I reached out to see if the payment could be postponed but I was told no. I explained that there wouldn't be funds, my account would be overdrafted and a $32 fee assessed. I reached out again and they said the system would keep attempting until they got the full amount so I will be racking up fees until I have funds again which could be weeks. Other similar apps were more understanding and helpful."
1370,Worst app. Customer service does not get back to u. I emailed and texted them about my problem and no one has gotten back to me. I can understand that customer service takes time but the mere fact that it you dont suggest that your app and services have alot of problem and you get alot of texts and emails you have to report to. The other issue I have is that you have to talk to customer service to cancel your subscription and since you dont get a reply back you might still get charged the fee.
1371,"App is Useless. I tried to use the app, but could not get past the address to verify identity. It does not pull up my address. Google maps doesn't even show my street's name, but on my husband's iPhone you can pull up street address and even see the house. So Albert is useless. There is a 31 on that street it's not a new house. It's been there. I'm very disappointed. There is no way to get help because I'm still in the start process of the app."
1372,Sends you in an endless cycle of bank verification all the while they want you to sign up for monthly investment services and have your paycheck direct deposited. I've had the app for 3 weeks and never gotten to the part where I could actually get an advance. There are so many bells and whistles to swipe thru. My account has been connected and verified for weeks. Why does it take 3 more days to verify for an advance.
1373,"While attempting to set up, App stopped working 3 times. When it came online I had to start again, Now says email already in use..Yes, Mine. Now I have a problem. I need to cancel and begin again ASAP. I do not like non working.procedures when it come to my bank account. Many ,many things can happen in a short period of time.Thank you MC"
1374,I really hate how misleading these cash advance apps can be for perspective customers. They lead you on to believe that you can receive an instant cash advance up to $200 as a first time borrower. Knowingly that's not the case. Make you jump through all these loops and twists only to offer you $25. If I needed 25 bucks I would scrap up the change in bottom of my sofa and not provide some random app with access to my personal financial information. Complete WASTE of time..Clear cache-UNINSTALL!
1375,"Accidentally deleted the app. Reinstalled it because I needed a cash advance (yes, the previous one was paid back. I have proof of this) since I reinstalled the app I can't access my account. Customer service has sent me on a wild goose chase of things to try. Finally get into my account via email, asks for my number says another account has that number. It doesn't, I know this for a fact. Not to mention customer service reps come off as rude and arrogant."
1376,"They automatically turn ON this stupid ""auto savings"" thing and if you happen to not notice and turn it off before it goes through, they'll go ahead and overdraw your account before they ignore you on their god awful customer service setup. If I could give less than 1 star I would. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
1377,I haven't used this app since 2020 and all of a sudden I go to check my account and it's withdrawn money. So I re download the app and the money isn't even showing up in the account. There's no way to contact support they send you a virtual text message this app is 🗑️. I'll have to go through my bank to get my funds back.
1378,"I'm told I qm not eligible for instant cash because of one category ""most recent paycheck received on time"". I've never once gotten a late paycheck, across every job I've ever had. Have a feeling this won't be fixed, can't count on help center or customer support, just keep getting the run around"
1379,This app has the worst customer service ever!!! The only way to contact support is through text genius but never replies to your text!!! Closing my account when support reply.
1380,I have 118 in my savings and I recently had to change cards. No its saying a connection error and it wont let me unlink so I can relink. Even though its telling me to unlink my account and relink it?? It did this too when I had to change banks. I lost 200+ dollars because they couldn't transfer the money. So dont say to unlink the account and then try relinking it?? Because apparently I cant.
1381,It's been a week now since I paid back the advance and it's still showing repayment in progress. A week now with no change. This is ridiculous!!
1382,"Tried to used as a budgeting account and now it won't link my bank account at all. Any time you click ""fix connection"" it will take you to a dead link."
1383,Update June 26. I'm still getting Albert charges after deleting my info days ago. They steal your money and WILL NOT lend anything like they say. Multiple charges made on my account that had nothing to do with the subscription. It's opt out for removing your money from your account to Albert savings. They conveniently wouldn't link the debit card associated with my bank account that I've had for decades I guess to avoid the instant cash option.
1384,I logged in to my bank and now you keep saying technical difficulty. Like you got my bank info and then don't wanna go any further. And trying to block me from the $250 cash fund. Feels like a ripoff and want to report it
1385,Very upsetting I used the cash loan for $75 dollars and worked great now it's been verifying for 2 months now. I'm going to uninstall unless this is fixed
1386,Waste of your time and money. They get you locked into a subscription for 5$ a month and you can't even cancel it unless you text their stupid text bot which does not work at all.
1387,I can't even use the app. I keep putting in the RIGHT log in for my bank and it keeps saying it's wrong. I Know it's right because I typed it into my bank app and presto it logged in.
1388,I been using this app for months now..the repayment process is to long on the advances...i get paid on thursday every two week and gotta wait almost a week for the repayment to process
1389,Automatically pulls money out of your accounts. Overdraft city. Support takes days to get back to you. Avoid
1390,Don't download this app. I did and borrowed $25 and they charge $4 to get it quickly. In which I'm fine with that. Then they took out $88 on top of that.
1391,"It was a good app, however I changed banks and while it did connect to my bank I kept getting an error message with my debit card. They asked me the same questions over and over and said my bank is unsupported. I called my bank and they saw no activity at all from Albert. It was a huge frustrating waste of time. They didn't have ANY ISSUES taking my monthly fee. Yet they couldn't advance me money. Go to a different company"
1392,This app seem to work okay at first but I had to link my bank account again. It's been checking a few more things for the last 2 weeks and the customer service is non existent. They barely respond and when they do it is with canned responses. I will be deleting this app. Editing to add: I did text that number and no response since 6/10/2021. Wish I could give 0 stars. Just trash. SMH
1393,Very difficult to cancel subscription have been trying for awhile now the text verification code is broken absolutely unacceptable
1394,"Used it once in a pinch, paid it back, then forgot about it as it was only needed once. Until today when the app sent me a message that it auto saved me 5.00, then i pulled up my bank account and they stole 5 bucks from me. There is no way to disable bank connection or delete account. The app auto sets up a ""Savings"" Feature that you also can not delete. This is legal theft as you have to agree to these terms when you sign up, but they hide these terms in their agreement. Contacting the developer wields nothing productive. Stay away from albert at all costs. and based on their BS responses to the SAME complaints in these reviews, we can see they are scammers. Whats worse is they know a stop payment at a traditional bank is 30 bucks, so they withdraw amounts lower then that so it would be useless for the person to request a stop pay on each one costing the end user more money."
1395,No! Not a good app! At all!!. You get a small advance. You pay it back. But not in the same amount that they gave you but more. Pretty double the amount what they gave you. And then they tell you we having trouble connecting to your bank. After they rob you for more money then you owe. And you fix that problem and then they want to tell you now we have to verify your account...WHY!! after they Just took money from me.....I'm a see what customer service say at 6am.......
1396,"Customer service is horrible. Only available via text. I have requested that my account be canceled several times, and they still hit my bank account for the $8 fee that I do not even recall signing up for. Be wary of this application. Also, if you leave a bad review, be ready for Albert to blame whatever issue there is on your Cell Phone provider, and not actually take accountability. This can be seen from the copious amount of reviews where Albert responds, blaming the issue on your provider."
1397,"This is the most horrible app! At first it worked and then I had to open a new account with the same bank and when I switched everything over, they had me enter and reenter not only my bank information but my debit card as well. Everytime I do this..it takes 3 days to verify..then it tells me there was a problem and I have to start all over again. Now they are blaming my bank! Stay away from Albert. Use Dave instead! And don't tell me to email you. You've had many chances to fix this and haven't"
1398,"It offers advance which takes three days then want you to repay in four days so you don't get the money when you need it but have to repay when the ask for it and it's automatic withdrawal so the take it back emediatly yet give you your advance three days late. Horrible app and you have to pay for their services. What's the point, I can tell you, there is no benefit."
1399,The app keeps telling me that I need to toggle bank accounts but my account is linked to the app and I keep getting this error message. I also tried to unsubscribe from genius and it won't let me it keeps taking $8 from me every month
1400,"I have been trying to cancel my albert subscription for months now! They have been charging me 5 dollars a month and I'm not even completely sure what it was actually getting me. Here's the kicker, you can only cancel your account by sending them a text message. Well after sending multiple texts to cancel my account and getting no response I had to call my bank and have a stop payment done so they cannot charge me any longer!"
1401,"I've been using this app for a little while now. Was working wonderfully. Last advance I got was paid back in time. Was going to get another one. Said I needed to wait 24 hours, which was fine, but now it's been 3 days, and says it can't find my paychecks now, which makes no sense because I just paid them back 3 days ago, so if I didn't have any paychecks, how did I pay them back? I've been waiting for 2 days for customer service to get back to me."
1402,This is the worst app. I got the albert cash card & they locked my card & wont let me have my money. They don't care if it's everything you got. If I could give negative stars I would.
1403,"Terrible, in times of dire need, this app will leave you dead and turn their back on you. No matter how loyal or often of a customer you are. Not to mention you have to keep a constant and open eye on your bank account because they will just take funds from without your knowledge or any reason. They charge you for things and services you don't have and will do it multiple times a month. I took my business elsewhere after they took unwarranted funds for services I don't subscribe to"
1404,"No good. Theres always an ""error"", whenever I try to link my bank account."
1405,"This is the 2nd time I have downloaded this app..I had forgotten why I deleted it a year ago until I was reminded again. It has a savings that they withdraw out of your linked bank account. I did not know they were going to withdraw everyday. I keep my account to the penny and because of their uncontrolled withdraws for my ""savings"" I am 157 overdrawn in my linked account. Real ""genious"". This app does not save you money you end up paying overdraft fees on what they take out everyday w/o u knwin"
1406,"The only way to cancel this subscription is by contacting support and wait for someone to get back to you. Something about having to search for how to cancel is a service is incredibly shady. Not only did I not consent to a subscription (I closed the app when presented the option) but it signed me up for one anyway and despite saying it can be canceled any time, it can only be canceled when a customer service representative feels like texting you back. Absolutely abysmal service. STAY AWAY!"
1407,"Horrible app. I was locked out for month as they kept charging $7 a months. Their goals saving section keeps taking money out if my account, and I cant withdraw it. Ive had nothing but problems, and lost money now as well. I find Truebill to be much better, and has much more features for the same cost. **My reply to Albert, ive already been working with support. I finally got my account deleted. Im still out all your fees.** I hope people read my review before signing up with such a shisty app"
1408,"No actual support. No number to call and automated replies for everything, which is frustrating for a financial app. Canceling procedures are confusing, not straight forward. There are better apps for managing investments and finances. Edit: For real, the only way to even try and get help is to talk to a bot through texts. Still out 11 months of their $5 subscription fee for an account that had a $0.00. They'll take your money even when they aren't doing anything. 🏴‍☠️🦜🏴‍☠️"
1409,"Terrible experience! This app withdraws from my bank account every month for some kind of ""savings"". I don't remember ever giving permission for that. What's worse is that I have been locked out of the app for weeks so I cannot stop them from withdrawing. I have tried to reset my password many times, I still cannot log in."
1410,"This app is horrible! Yes, you get the money which is great but what they don't really explain is that they will take more money out of your account for ""savings"" you don't get the option to turn this off unless you pay for it. They took $59 out of my account which made my account go negative. It took 3 days for that to post to their ""savings"" and then another 3 days to get it back. I'm still waiting on that money to go back into my account. So I had to borrow from them again because of this."
1411,"Took my money but never offered the advance that they advertised. Told me I needed to link a bank account to get an advance but my account was already linked, at least strongly enough for them to take my 8 dollar monthly fee. Thier fee is the most out of any of these apps that I have used, Dave is cheaper and actually works! Do not download this if you need help cause all it will do is take your money!"
1412,I recently deleted my account due to the factor they have been withdrawing money out of my account by small increments. I suggest if you want to run with something that's going to help you out these guys are not the people to go with. I was suggested this app and when I looked at my account and saw small amount of money coming out of my account I was not very happy. If you want people to go through your app fix your damn accounting it is going to get you a lawsuit.
1413,"USE DAVE, NOT ALBERT Savings was transferred without authorization (and if authorization was given during setup, the request was hidden in fine print). It requests WAY too much information even though they're supposedly not checking your credit. I would NEVER recommend this app."
1414,"A month ago this app would have received 5 stars from me. Recently, my banks were disconnected and I have not been able to reconnect them. I believe that this is simply an issue that might be resolved with an update. Until then, I'm not able to use it."
1415,Horrible app. Couldn't even try it because it will not let me log into my bank despite the fact my user name and password are correct because I going to my bank account daily so I know my user name and password by heart. They can't even connect to my bank account to allow me to use the app. if it could be a 0 star it would.
1416,"Terrible. I dont understand how I can link my bank account and not card. Plaid works with both on plenty of other apps, aside from this one. When I texted customer service, they asked if I wanted them to delete my account. Piss poor app with piss poor customer service. If you can, use earnin. They charge interest but at you are paying for a working app."
1417,"Horrible experience...I borrowed the max of $50 which wasn't due until Friday, but they took the money right back out of my account! Wth, the whole purpose was to get a few groceries til payday, now I'm in the same boat I started in . This app sucks and I will NEVER use it again."
1418,"I thought this was a good app at first. Everything was good for the first 2 days, but on the 3rd day I received a notification from my bank stating that this app overdrew from my account and put it in the negative $50.00 for a ""rainy day"" fund that I can't access nor use. So now my bank account is overdrawn $50.00 plus I was charged an overdraft fee of $35.00 from my bank. So now I am $85.00 in the negative for a banking transaction that I did not ask for, nor did I authorize either"
1419,I am having trouble linking my bank. I bank with chartway. I'm unable to get pass the phone verification I keep getting an error message that says you are having internal issues and to try back later ..well this has been going on all day. I have tried reaching out to support and had trouble sending message to (639-37).
1420,I downloaded this app for a quick 25 bucks as was advertiesed and now since im trying to delete my account they will not respond by text nor email and they keep overdrafting my account with no reason and trying to delete is not an option
1421,"I dont rate apps ever.. and I'm a hard guy go upset.. unless you take my money. I transferred $124 to my bank, it NEVER came. They said it had went through, but bank couldn't do anything, and had made it apparent it hasn't. I got no help, and Albert stole my money."
1422,"Logged into my bank account via plaid to connect my account and it just sat there, I was never returned to the Albert App."
1423,"READ ALL NEGATIVE BEFORE USING... Customer service took 4 ½ hours to respond to closing my account. My snk account was being charged every month but they never were able to access my account for the service they said they could provide. Now, they are telling me that they will refund today's charge for next month's service, but not for the last 6 months of service they didn't provide. Additionally, their response answers nothing about the issues in my review. Use another service"
1424,"If I can figure out how to unsubscribe to this app I will, I wouldn't recommend using it it's done nothing for me at all, I've had it for about a month maybe a little longer and haven't been able to do anything on it the entire time it's been saying that they're verifying my bank account like they can't clearly see that my paycheck goes in it every week what a waste of time. Do yourself a favor and don't download or subscribe to this"
1425,Not a good app. Asked to reset my password since I got a new phone to see why 80$ was taken out of my bank today by them and it never comes I've been trying all day long. All they are doing is stealing money from people. If I could give it 0 stars I would. I want my 80 dollars back.
1426,"Absolutely horrible I cancelled my account and was still charged 88.00 for genius whis is a total waste ... Should of know when the only way to contact support is via text and response times are at THEIR EARLIEST CONVINCE and emailing them is no better, I was told that although I did deactivate my account that there is another account that I made as well which I am very sure I didn't Now it's looking like I'll be taking a $88.00 loss which I seriously can't afford DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"
1427,Ridiculous. If this app can't be better after all the complaints....give up Albert. Give up. I'm giving it a One star... But ZERO Stars should be an Option. App never linked my account. It said there has to be at least 10.00 in my account in order to link.... Well there is.... And STILL showing the same ERROR message. I give up on you Albert. Take a long long hike and then jump off a big cliff.
1428,It's a scam!! They took money out of my account for albert savings I didn't authorize then when I finally got in contact with the text customer service they said it was bc I had a duplicate account which I don't. The said the closed the duplicate and will refund my money in 3 to 5 days causing me fees with my bank. Now I want to close my account and no one will respond. They are not worth it I regret ever starting with them!!
1429,"I'm trying to start my investing and every time for the past few days it says ""error, there was an error trying to start your investment"" or whatever the exact words are. Either way, it's useless. Guess I'll try Acorns."
1430,"I singed up with the service 4 days ago and with the savings feature I put $100 into the ""rainy day fund"". The money is out of my actual bank account and is on the app. I can't withdraw my money out of the app and it's been past the days it said it should be processed. I sent texts and an email to try and figure out whats going on. When I do try to withdraw money from the rainy day fund it says there's $0 I can withdraw even though the account says there's &125 in the account."
1431,"Charged me a NSF fee!!!! I had this app for a week, it was pulling money out without my authorization, no money in bank gave me a 35$ fee. This money is supposed to help me save not spend on stupid fees. I do not recommend to anyone trying to get out of debt. Scam Update 4/16/21 They said they would refund it but sent it to my rainy day fund even though previously they told me I could not get it refunded because I closed my albert account. Still no money back. Still a scam."
1432,My account has been suspended because of too many log in attempts when I was entering the correct PW. Get a notification to text a number for help but I never receive a response. Its totally ridiculous that I can't log into my account or get any assistance.
1433,"I have had nothing but trouble with this app. I've had money taken from my bank account yet i have no idea why and I don't see that it was used to fund my account. I've tried to close my account and texted the ""real humans"" via the Genius part and still nothing. I want my money back and my account closed. B"
1434,It's not instant nor easy!... they check everything and make sure your bank has a certain amount... If we download this app and sign up is for a reason not to get denied
1435,"Great concept if it worked. I've reached out to support 4x in a month & not one reply! All qualifications have been met, yet I still can't get $1 out of this app. Going back to Dave👋"
1436,Totally horrible. Takes money out of my account w/o prior authorization or notification. Doesn't loan you anything. Soon as I get my money back I will NEVER use this app again. Dave is the way to go.
1437,Be very wary when using Albert!! I tried using it and I couldnt get my bank card to stay linked to my Albert account I tried numerous times over a month span but my card kept getting unlinked so I would link it back then the same thing would happen plus Albert was taking money off my card while it wasnt even linked..I dont know how they were taking money off my card while it wasnt even linked to my Albert account but they did and I never got the opportunity to borrow money!!
1438,I have requested several times to several different numbers that they have and they never reply to but keep saying they're waiting on my reply and won't cancel this stupid subscription or closes this stupid account and give me back the $6 they stolen unauthorized from my account. Do not use this app I do not recommend it!!!!
1439,I downloaded this app to help me budget but at the beginning trying to setting up the account it's hard it keeps getting me backed up and say that my credentials do not match match the security codes they're sending are not working on my bank and I had to delete the app because i couldn't get it to work or set up my bank.
1440,"This app is trash, I paid for a year of their ""Genius"" services and never get a response for anything. The savings features are too unpredictable for me to be comfortable with using them anymore. I just want to withdrawl my money at this point back to my bank and close my Albert account, and a refund for the useless ""Genius"" services is absouletly warranted. I can't get a response for that either. *And they havent responded to my messages like they responded to me, thats a complete lie."
1441,Cannot ever get in touch with support. Send text messages that don't go through. Cannot bar scan drivers license to verify for investments. Cannot even close account down.
1442,"Set up an account to save money, the account is still active but I cannot log into it. Resetting the password didn't work, and all links just reopen the app to not let me sign in."
1443,Albert is not a good app at all i dont care for it they not up front with fees you cant access 100 when you start only 25 over draft clearly a waste of time other apps are so much better if you take the time to find them
1444,"Waste of money...not helpful at all and to top it off, all the months of wasted money, can't get a refund. I hardly ever leave bad reviews but when I do, know it's bad."
1445,Lost 400$+ out of my account no track record just added bonus of like 0.10 to cover tracks of transactions do not fall for this app store it somewhere else
1446,"I can log into my banking app just fine, try to use Albert, it tells me I have the wrong answers. Now my Albert account is locked and I need to reset my banking password to get it unlocked? Next."
1447,I downloaded the app gave it all my banking information which was PayPal the next thing I know PayPal canceled my account said I had given fraudulent information or something to that nature so Albert did something to my checking account that got cancelled. Be careful with this app I should have listened to some of the reviews
1448,"After months I just realized even after getting off the app, its still been taking money out of my bank every month. This is a scam, they don't lend you money, they sign you up for a million things that will slowly drain your bank account."
1449,Apps broken. Tells me toggle my account yet nothing is fixed. Havent got no advance since may yet the app keeps taking money from my account.
1450,You guys took an extra $54.99 out of my account and I've been trying to contact your support since 6:00 this morning have eight emails to y'all and at least six texts and no one has respond to me I have even subscribed to your monthly genius and I still can't get no response so when is somebody going to reach out to me to help me fix this extra money yall took out my account
1451,I can't log in and this app is nothing like I thought it was. I'm trying to cancel my membership and delete the app!!!! But I CAN'T LOG IN!!!!
1452,"They dont and DO NOT honor their Perks program (dunkins CVS, Other Stores) unless u use THEIR debit card they Demand u switch from your bank too.. they want u to not think for yourself. u cannot call a number and talk to ANYONE they want you to use an in app chatbot that doesnt respond asap and its NOT intelligent and smart .."
1453,They sux they say you can get a advance but if you are minus in accout they wont they say that its to low to certify even though you just had your acct linked. And they dont show income so they dont have to give you advance . cant get 20 for 90 damn days cause i had my friend sign up. They dont show you that. Cancelling my subscribtion
1454,Horrible don't waste your time have not used this app and months did not own them nothing and 3 and the morning they come take 53.99 out my account then my card was disabled like a thief in the night not do not waste your time I been cancelled then and still try to take money from my account snake
1455,250 instantly huh? Apparently I can only get up to $25 with plenty of income. And they set the pay back date for two days away on a day ive never been paid on. Beyond weak sauce.
1456,This app keeps restarting my phone. I cant even open it. It's frustrating I haven't gotten a chance to use it.
1457,Worst customer service experience I've already paid my advance but it's taking forever to request a advance customer service taking forever to get in contact with
1458,Never actually used or established a usable account and have been being deducted out of every direct deposit payroll check before Ive even had a chance to touch my own money. Redownloading now to cancel these robbing POS es
1459,This app withdraw money without coming back to the client! lol like we got your info we know what's best for you!! I was talking about it to a friend when she told me the same thing happened w her!!
1460,AWFUL. couldnt connect to my bank but yet could take money out of it. Rediculous.
1461,I keep having to cancel the stupid app because they keep reopening the app to charge me I want a refund I haven't used the app in months and it won't stop charging me if I don't get a refund I'm going to report this app I keep closing the app but you guys keep reopening it to charge me and I still haven't gotten a refund yet at this point and it's been 4 months since I tried to cancel this is a scam
1462,This app startin to feel like a scam. So it automaticaly takes money off my card but when I tried to get money back for an emergeny its a debit card error? Its not an error when yall take it though this is a scam
1463,This app is bull it upgraded me without permission and did not tl me it started taking 7 dollars a month and then I borrowed 25 to be paid in payday and it took it back within a week . It steals money from you
1464,I just got advance on the 8th when i got paid and it took the advance out today out of my account instead of waiting until my next pay day it was only a day and they took it out of my account
1465,"Taking back my 5 stars. Dont use this app. They will just attempt as many times as theyd like to get their money back, even first thing in the morning when i dont get paid til the afternoon. Deleting my account. Horseshit. Use Dave!!"
1466,Already left a review cant find it they replied telling me their geniuses want to help but in the app they told me multiple times they couldn't do anything about verifying who I am. Is it because I didn't put apt. 2 and only put the number 2 in my address line? Who knows...now they can't locate my account because for the 2nd time in a row they've been unhelpful so I deleted my account. Why would I keep something that can't fix itself or help its customers get verified. I have my ID and ss
1467,This app is a scam they have been telling me they can not connect to my account yet they continue to take money out of my account everytime I try to cash my money back to myself it says it can not connect to my account can not reach anyone nor do they respond I am contacting my bank at this point
1468,THIS THING SUCKS AND IS A LIE. I WENT AND DID EVERYTHING IT SAID TO DO TO GET SOME MONEY AND IT NEVER GAVE ME A PENNY SO I DELETED THIS GARBAGE. DONT FALL FOR IT!!!!!
1469,Verified my bank but couldn't get a measley 25 bucks..
1470,They suck trying to say my bank is not a real bank and then you must have $10 in your before you can even start a account with them not good way of doing business if you ask me just not worth the time or effort at all very disappointed in this I would not recommend it to anyone at all
1471,Another shady bank. Waste of time!
1472,P yo
1473,Great app
1474,"They dont and DO NOT honor their Perks program (dunkins CVS, Other Stores) unless u use THEIR debit card they Demand u switch from your bank too.. they want u to not think for yourself. u cannot call a number and talk to ANYONE they want you to use an in app chatbot that doesnt respond asap and its NOT intelligent and smart .."
1475,"I have had no issues so far... **** Came back to give one star. I have never had so much trouble with one of these advance apps. Every single week since I've had this app, as soon as I pay back my advance a glitch happens and it says I don't qualify because I have $0 in the bank, even though I have well over $100 in there at the time. I've had to text customer service for help every week.And it takes me 3 days of going back and forth this app sucks 😤 no problems w/ Brigit. Use them instead....."
1476,This app used to be great connected to my bank let me borrow a few times Then they updated the app and came out with a card now it won't connect to same bank I had connected before I've tried connecting it everyday for the past month this really frustrates me you guys were the only app to accept my bank now you won't great...
1477,Not what I was looking for. And it BETTER NOT take money out my account!!
1478,Love the idea but my phone shuts down every time I try to open the app. I have to start all over with the uninstall an download and sign in
1479,I am not able to access money and it is constantly taking money from my checking account.
1480,"they are a fake, and they are a lie! they take your money and move it how they want!"
1481,"They automatically turn ON this stupid ""auto savings"" thing and if you happen to not notice and turn it off before it goes through, they'll go ahead and overdraw your account before they ignore you on their god awful customer service setup. If I could give less than 1 star I would. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
1482,Come on guys u tell me u have trouble accessing my card really u had no trouble accessing it to take money last week I was born at night but it wasn't last night
1483,Every time I download this app Im stuck at the loading screen with the lock animation. This app sucks
1484,Man this app want let you get anything
1485,"Blah, needs work on software!"
1486,Very difficult to cancel subscription have been trying for awhile now the text verification code is broken absolutely unacceptable
1487,It's been a week now since I paid back the advance and it's still showing repayment in progress. A week now with no change. This is ridiculous!!
1488,Apps broken. Tells me toggle my account yet nothing is fixed. Havent got no advance since may yet the app keeps taking money from my account.
1489,These people will steal your money! They stole over $900 from my account and will not return the money. I have bank statements showing they removed funds and I never had access to the so called savings to recover the over $900 taken. These people are straight up thieves!!! Don't trust them with your money! I would give them no stars if it were an options. And after trying to recover the money they only have a text or email option in which they make zero effort to resolve the matter!
1490,Bad customer service. I have Albert cash and wanted to know why I can't use my card with my own money that I put in that bank account. They keep asking me different questions but never answered my question. Never using this service again!!!! And I'll make sure none of my friends or family ever uses Albert.
1491,I opted out looks like Albert wants to change an amount to use account looks like you were charging me 48 dollars today
1492,This app is bs! They took my money off my chime account and i never used albert only downloaded it. I dont appreciate albert just takin my money like that. Thats a lawsuit
1493,I filled out everything and you say it's not me . So I guess I can't be part of this.
1494,The app keeps telling me that I need to toggle bank accounts but my account is linked to the app and I keep getting this error message. I also tried to unsubscribe from genius and it won't let me it keeps taking $8 from me every month
1495,When check my identity whit social security when going to continue tell me too much attempt call number never give me be careful stolen identity
1496,How come you removed my bank
1497,Automatically pulls money out of your accounts. Overdraft city. Support takes days to get back to you. Avoid
1498,Haven't used Albert in months and I cancelled my subscription but yet I still get charged every month
1499,There is no way to contact these people and they took my money
1500,After canceling the subscription this thieves still get my account info and charge me and this app is garbage nothing interesting there not helping me to save they are stealing from me
1501,Can not get back information put in this is not a good idea for you and I I would not recommend it to anyone
1502,Waste of your time and money. They get you locked into a subscription for 5$ a month and you can't even cancel it unless you text their stupid text bot which does not work at all.
1503,I been using this app for months now..the repayment process is to long on the advances...i get paid on thursday every two week and gotta wait almost a week for the repayment to process
1504,"Tried to used as a budgeting account and now it won't link my bank account at all. Any time you click ""fix connection"" it will take you to a dead link."
1505,"This app is trash I have money in my rainy day savings and I no longer have that account from 2 years ago and I no longer have the account connected with that savings, and won't let me transfer without bank statements of the inactive account."
1506,When putting my social it says it can't identify...what the world?!!!
1507,They don't support my credit union. They can keep getting my review deleted but I'll keep putting it back up
1508,This app sucks balls I will never use it again
1509,Gimmick for direct deposit and small auto pay fees
1510,Ok
1511,"Logged into my bank account via plaid to connect my account and it just sat there, I was never returned to the Albert App."
1512,Can you please stop taking from my account
1513,App sucks
1514,I've been waiting about a week for approval my checking account. Most of the other apps are same day. If you're looking for a quick advance this app does not seem to be it
1515,I really hate how misleading these cash advance apps can be for perspective customers. They lead you on to believe that you can receive an instant cash advance up to $200 as a first time borrower. Knowingly that's not the case. Make you jump through all these loops and twists only to offer you $25. If I needed 25 bucks I would scrap up the change in bottom of my sofa and not provide some random app with access to my personal financial information. Complete WASTE of time..Clear cache-UNINSTALL!
1516,Trying to sign up but it won't accept my SSN.
1517,I have 118 in my savings and I recently had to change cards. No its saying a connection error and it wont let me unlink so I can relink. Even though its telling me to unlink my account and relink it?? It did this too when I had to change banks. I lost 200+ dollars because they couldn't transfer the money. So dont say to unlink the account and then try relinking it?? Because apparently I cant.
1518,"App is Useless. I tried to use the app, but could not get past the address to verify identity. It does not pull up my address. Google maps doesn't even show my street's name, but on my husband's iPhone you can pull up street address and even see the house. So Albert is useless. There is a 31 on that street it's not a new house. It's been there. I'm very disappointed. There is no way to get help because I'm still in the start process of the app."
1519,M.
1520,Albert is not a good app at all i dont care for it they not up front with fees you cant access 100 when you start only 25 over draft clearly a waste of time other apps are so much better if you take the time to find them
1521,It says that i should have atleast 10 dollars in my bank account when i have more than that and it dosent let me log in
1522,App is completely broken it won't let me it won't let me link my account.
1523,"Worst customer service ever!! The app was great until recently when I lost my job. I reached out to see if the payment could be postponed but I was told no. I explained that there wouldn't be funds, my account would be overdrafted and a $32 fee assessed. I reached out again and they said the system would keep attempting until they got the full amount so I will be racking up fees until I have funds again which could be weeks. Other similar apps were more understanding and helpful."
1524,The app doesn't update it doesn't put your account back in its normal standing as before customer service is omg so freaking horrible they start out good then the service and app goes very bad fast .........
1525,250 instantly huh? Apparently I can only get up to $25 with plenty of income. And they set the pay back date for two days away on a day ive never been paid on. Beyond weak sauce.
1526,Horrible I've used your app one time over a year ago and u guys are still taking money from my account and sending me emails saying I owe u guys hundreds of dollars don't use this app big fkn scam
1527,I haven't used this app since 2020 and all of a sudden I go to check my account and it's withdrawn money. So I re download the app and the money isn't even showing up in the account. There's no way to contact support they send you a virtual text message this app is 🗑️. I'll have to go through my bank to get my funds back.
1528,"I can't set the date to payback so it looks like I'm paying Albert back late and I'm not its bc the date the app chooses isn't my pay day, so then I can't get any fast cash for months due to the late payment ...I've only got $25 at the most bc this app doesn't accept keybank..."
1529,NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS FROM TRYING TO CONNECT TO MY BANK TO GET THE SO CALLED $250 loan. I tried 20 times and still couldn't get answers from anyone
1530,I can't even use the app. I keep putting in the RIGHT log in for my bank and it keeps saying it's wrong. I Know it's right because I typed it into my bank app and presto it logged in.
1531,Downloaded the app because my paycheck was short wont let me connect because I need 10 dollars in my account when I did had it in my account it still wouldn't go through
1532,"While attempting to set up, App stopped working 3 times. When it came online I had to start again, Now says email already in use..Yes, Mine. Now I have a problem. I need to cancel and begin again ASAP. I do not like non working.procedures when it come to my bank account. Many ,many things can happen in a short period of time.Thank you MC"
1533,Trash doesn't work
1534,THIS APP ASKS FOR YOUR SSN!! NO THANK YOU!!!!
1535,Very upsetting I used the cash loan for $75 dollars and worked great now it's been verifying for 2 months now. I'm going to uninstall unless this is fixed
1536,I believe that Albert sells our information to third-party entities because since applying to their services I have sporadically been receiving calls and text messages from fraudulent numbers.
1537,Another junk app! good luck !
1538,app is glitching. not working
1539,Update June 26. I'm still getting Albert charges after deleting my info days ago. They steal your money and WILL NOT lend anything like they say. Multiple charges made on my account that had nothing to do with the subscription. It's opt out for removing your money from your account to Albert savings. They conveniently wouldn't link the debit card associated with my bank account that I've had for decades I guess to avoid the instant cash option.
1540,"I'm told I qm not eligible for instant cash because of one category ""most recent paycheck received on time"". I've never once gotten a late paycheck, across every job I've ever had. Have a feeling this won't be fixed, can't count on help center or customer support, just keep getting the run around"
1541,I recently deleted my account due to the factor they have been withdrawing money out of my account by small increments. I suggest if you want to run with something that's going to help you out these guys are not the people to go with. I was suggested this app and when I looked at my account and saw small amount of money coming out of my account I was not very happy. If you want people to go through your app fix your damn accounting it is going to get you a lawsuit.
1542,This is the worst app. I got the albert cash card & they locked my card & wont let me have my money. They don't care if it's everything you got. If I could give negative stars I would.
1543,ALBERT gets my payday wrong ALL THE TIME. And drains your account on the wrong day because of this. I am done with Albert. TRY BRIDGIT!!!!
1544,I want to cancel but it wont let me i have tried for the past 2 months
1545,Crooks. So called Geniuses never get back to you. They are still holding onto my money that I've been trying to get for over a week. They call themselves geniuses. That's comical
1546,"Accidentally deleted the app. Reinstalled it because I needed a cash advance (yes, the previous one was paid back. I have proof of this) since I reinstalled the app I can't access my account. Customer service has sent me on a wild goose chase of things to try. Finally get into my account via email, asks for my number says another account has that number. It doesn't, I know this for a fact. Not to mention customer service reps come off as rude and arrogant."
1547,Don't download this app. I did and borrowed $25 and they charge $4 to get it quickly. In which I'm fine with that. Then they took out $88 on top of that.
1548,"I tried to get help with a loan, didn't get any help, now I keep email's talking I have an account where as I don't . I think it's all a scam so I'm telling everyone to watch out"
1549,IT SUPER SUCKS IT NEVER FINISH COMPLETING ACCOUNT
1550,"My account is not in the negative and I paid them back, so I don't understand why I can use the cash advance."
1551,Because you could not verify my information and I tried three times I am not allowed to do it anymore I have been locked out I think it's unfair. You have me try 3 times to verify my information even trying a different bank not letting us know that after three times we get locked out and can't do it anymore because of security very very unfair!
1552,If you want them to stop they won't so you have to make them stop from your own bank definitely do not sign up for this its dumb they said they couldn't find my profile when they clearly are taking money out of my account ill have ya Albert yall suck
1553,Thank you for your reviews...easy decision..NOT!
1554,I just want to make sure you know that not a good job for you to tell everyone to text you that what people do that don't want to hear the truth and not confident texting is a way to communicate not the way to communicate especially about finances
1555,This app is a total joke. It took forever to download and then it says it can't verify who I am my information is wrong what the hell I put it all in there my information is right this app is wrong. It's garbage
1556,I dont know how they use the name genius. Cause there are some dumb mofos there. I cant remember them doing anything really to make myself or my momey smarter. I just know i want nothing to do with them.
1557,This app has the worst customer service ever!!! The only way to contact support is through text genius but never replies to your text!!! Closing my account when support reply.
1558,Don't work
1559,Won't let me contact bank
1560,This app kept saying my bank connection was not connected but it was. It was a horrible experience
1561,They say they'll lend you money but there's no app functionality for it. Like.... where is it dude?
1562,"Albert sucks and somehow your app restarts my phone , it's trash."
1563,Waiting to hear if I was approved for advance. The process is not clear or quick.
1564,Even after I discontinued my service and deleted the app I have been charged every month $5 cannot get ahold of anybody to get the charges stopped and what they have taken refunded back to me. They will rip you off stay away
1565,No a cash advance app
1566,Lost 400$+ out of my account no track record just added bonus of like 0.10 to cover tracks of transactions do not fall for this app store it somewhere else
1567,I logged in to my bank and now you keep saying technical difficulty. Like you got my bank info and then don't wanna go any further. And trying to block me from the $250 cash fund. Feels like a ripoff and want to report it
1568,"UNINSTALLING IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY! I was on my way to use this app. In the process of just making my password, I started getting bs errors. Every time I would type the letter I the app would do some bs like (illi okyy). So I'm UNINSTALLING IMMEDIATELY!"
1569,"Too many errors.in such a short time. Tried to set up accounts to no avail kept getting an error oops something went wrong, really? With that said I tried to unlink my accounts again, oops something went wrong I'm scared I gave them way too much of my information I'm probably screwed."
1570,"Extremely laggy, & the fact that I have to relink my accounts every other day is irritating. Been using for a couple to few months over the years on & off, love the ability to enter assets."
1571,Downloaded couldn't link my bank account couldn't move on. Ttied several days and same message. Would love to use but won't let you pass not sure if its Plaid or what but seems odd that if you don't have a way to move on and try again later and contoniue with the set up.
1572,An application was submitted to a loan company that I never applied for when I set up an acct to prequalify and I hadn't even finished setting up the acct to prequalify...this sucks
1573,"Not nearly as the commercials portray it. Just sends you to web sites, doesn't streamline. No use"
1574,Used to be fantastic and used to be my absolute favorite credit app to go on and check my credit etc that is up until it stopped letting me log in over a month ago and no matter what I have tried including contacting customer support 4 times they did nothing to help and here we are with all my private personal information out there and I can't access it to even delete my account it's a nightmare
1575,"App is good idea, but many investment/securities institutions aren't available to link accounts and I have to constantly relink my financial accounts. Not really of use to me. In fact, two of my Financial institutions disappeared from the list of available Banks and had to unlink them."
1576,"YOUR APP SUCKS!!! Dispite all is security features using SMS to verify my phone, I discovered the verification code is being sent to the wrong number. I can see the wrong phone number in my profile settings. I tried to enter the correct number but the app says it already has it so it remains unchanged."
1577,My experian score is 730 The rest are quite a but higher So no I do not particularly like this app.
1578,Says that it can connect credit card and bank account data but is unable to connect a citi card. Will only say that I have the right login info but there is no account. Contacted support and still no reply.
1579,It will not let me sign into my bank account it keep getting a error message
1580,"Does not support VOIP phone lines like Republic Wireless so I can't link any of my accounts. Plenty of apps support VOIP, no reason not to."
1581,Can't verified my address - I living 8 y . On the same address!!! Crazy . I can't even sign up!
1582,Keeps telling me my phone number is not a valid US number. I've had this same number for over 10 years
1583,Experiencing difficullties loading
1584,In the beginning I love this app but now it has been crashing 😕 on me!!
1585,Just wanted to see my credit scores and check out the app to see if I wanted to actually use it WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO ADD MY BANK ACCOUNT BEFORE I CAN ACCESS ANYTHING. Not gonna happen. Shady af seems almost like a scam
1586,Keeps prompting me to link accounts which I have already done and then crashes. Currently a worthless app.
1587,My score sais 728...i went i to an rv dealership to buy my dream rig and was quickly kicked in the balls when they pulled my score up and there was over 100 difference lower than what this app told me. So im not happy at all. Wby is there succk a large difference from the true number????
1588,I no more installed this app signed in had forgotten my password and changed it and put in my storage added the Nerdwallet my email & password to it. Went to open the app because I opened a different link sign in again to be told it was either the wrong email and/ or password did it a second time in case and got the same message. I saved my signin info but oviously it was removed. I no longer trust this app. I'm uninstalling and deleting my account.
1589,never got the money and cant even log in now after updating .
1590,This app sucks. They try helping but if ur checking account is 1500 due to checks not posted yet they suggest putting a bunch in savings. If u do then u overdraft. Then if u suggest 1500 in savings they see 2000 so u should invest 500. My savings is my emergency fund I don't want to risk losing it . If it's tied up in investments how do I get it in am emergency??? Poorly run app. AVOID!!!!!!!
1591,"Would have loved to have tried the app as I love the website, but I didn't want to link my credit score as the only goal for the app was easy access to articles and information."
1592,"Not good, i cant sign up, Puerto Rico is not available on states list."
1593,I got to the link portion and suddenly the app spazzed and wouldn't let me get past the green N logo. Looked promising but apparently not.
1594,I just wanted something I could track my expenses on. My bank is a small credit union and not on the list so I can't move forward. Garbage.
1595,"Simply wanted to review Credit Cards, but this app requires way too much PII just to access it. Hard pass."
1596,Not going to spend 20 minutes scrolling through years so that I can put in my birthday. A lot of people to type it in instead of having to scroll through calendar after calendar. Just deleted the app and didn't even bother using it because of that.
1597,"So much potential, but it falls so short. I was so excited when I found it, it appeared to have so many great features. I have run into a few issues that have me ready to give up completely. 1. Syncing is hit and miss across most of my accounts. About half of them have not had a successful sync in 7 days at this point. 2.The information in the app is wildly different than the information on the website. $30K difference in my assets between the 2! Also, categories I set on the website do not follow through to the app, which doesn't allow me to set my own categories. For example, accounts that are categorized as retirement on one side show as savings on the other. 3. They don't include CDs in any calculations. I understand the business reason (it doesn't really help them in what they are trying to sell) But their site says I need to beef up my savings for an emergency when I have way more than the amount they say I need to beef up in CDs. It's not a full view of my wealth without it."
1598,It dont add US bank but theres an option for usbank? Like what? Fix this
1599,"I have been using Nerdwallet for about a month now and all I can say is that it is absolutely terrible. My eight year old niece could keep track of my bills, spending and accounts more effectively. Nothing seems to update. Linked accounts need to be re-verified daily. The only decent thing that Nerdwallet has accomplished is the movement of my credit score, which is days behind Credit Karma. I have already contacted customer service and that was two weeks ago. Since then, nothing has changed."
1600,Absolute garbage!!! Every since I lost my phone I have been unable to log back into this app on my new phone.. I get the run around on it and this after I got locked out of if for 30 days trying to get back into it. Rediculous!! If they do not contact me soon I am removing it and going elsewhere for my credit score. I wish I could rate it less than 1 star!
1601,"The app is very confusing and is too busy. I was expecting it to pull in my data from different accounts to see trends of bills from my bank and credit cards. It pulled the data, but only understood my bank's trends. I thought maybe I could customize my dashboard to be more useful to me, but nope. It doesn't even split accounts up, you can ""hide"" them but you can tell which is a savings or not on the dashboard. You can't say out of my income I'm putting $X into my savings etc. I'll stick to Expense Manager app.Expense Manager may not be the most sophisticated app, but it's easy to use and understand."
1602,"Can't even do what the app is supposed to do. I set a budget. Link my cards and manually put in bills that aren't part of my cards but after I've marked those bills at paid, it regards them at $0 as if they never existed at all. It's been a whole week since I've reported this and nothing has been done with this app breaking bug. Don't use this app. Literally useless."
1603,"Especially since the update this app is a waste. Every time I try to open it, it says ""Opps! We're having trouble connecting to NerdWallet. Please try again later."" Plus it is extremely annoying if it is past the due date for a bill it gets automatically categorized as paid. I know when the due date is but that doesn't mean that they took the money and that it is actually out of my account already."
1604,"Good in theory but logs out of all accounts. Different credit cards, auto loan and retirement accounts are logged out at least once a week. They say it's not a problem on their end but with each individual lender. Not worth the hassle to verify 8 account every week. If they can fix this it would be a perfect app"
1605,I can't link my bank account. The app said my cell number isn't a valid number.
1606,*update* it's been two days since the update and I've finally just uninstalled the app. It's completely useless without the accounts overview that lets you see everything in one place.* This is one of those apps that used to be great but with each update they remove something and now you're basically just downloqding an app that shows you credit card ads. Pointless. Getting rid of the accounts tab and replacing it with a savings tab was a dumb idea...
1607,Since I have used this app I have experienced a lot of fraud with my personal info. I'm now battling fraud with really high amount of money that was used with my info on this app in states I'm not even in. So do not give any personal information about your self with this app.
1608,"Didn't have half of the accounts I use. Couldn't find my bank, which is a FCU. App kept freezing. Would not accept my credentials even though I entered them exactly as though I were paying a bill. Can't verify through fingerprint with bill pay apps you have already verified by fingerprint. I'd rather pay my bills with one app than 15-20 apps. We thought that was what we were getting. We were wrong. Uninstalled within an hour of frustration. No pictures for us!"
1609,"Honestly it kind of sucks. The tracking feature is lacking and isn't accurately depict your spending. My bank account never stays linked for more than a couple hours, and trying to relink it is absolutely hellacious. Everything about this app is sluggish and bulky. Guess I have to go back to Mint, at least it provides accurate information and is hardware bearable to use."
1610,This app is full of ad . Nothing else and does not create any value . I downloaded it to simulate my credit score but this rubbish app does not have any options to see what will happen if I pay my debt
1611,"My account wouldn't update. I kept having to verify my account several times to try to even refresh my info after I've gotten paid, and even before refreshing, all my previous spending and income was wiped. Got tired of having to refresh and not be able to get account details. Tried to cancel my account with Nerdwallet, and couldn't find it anywhere, so i just removed my bank info and deleted app. This was a waste of my time."
1612,"Just decided I can't login anymore. It was a good app while it was working but it has suddenly decided that my Google account doesn't work with it anymore. Kind of lame, it should not have logged me out to begin with as I did not ask for the app to do so and I had checked to keep me logged in. Heads-up, that option clearly doesn't matter as the app will do whatever it pleases apparently."
1613,"Horrendous experience trying to add all my accounts, all my info is correct yet I keep getting login errors then get locked out. Can't even add all my accounts like Verizon. Only so helpful when you cant see the details of purchases, ie: showed I spent $200 on Amazon, but without a breakdown of the actual purchase it's really not that intuitive or helpful. Every time I log in one account or another has a problem and has to be re-logged in. Not worth the headache of using this app."
1614,Post install setup flow is a bad experience. There is a screen where you can select the types of use cases you plan on leveraging the app for. I was planning on clicking a few but when I clicked the first one (credit score) it automatically navigated into the credit score setup flow. Upon completion it didn't take me back to select another one. So I then I linked my bank account and the account balances were incorrect. The app allowed me to unlink my bank account but not my credit score account.
1615,"Linking to loans doesn't actually work. Because my servicer asks for the answer to a security question, nerdwallet just sends you an infinite circle where you log in via a webview to the loan website, only to have none of that info linked back to the nerdwallet app in a meaningful way, keeping the account unlinked. Do it again and the same result occurs. Mint actually manages to do this properly. Perhaps it works on the web, but if you're going to offer a linking flow in the app, it should work."
1616,"Works ok when it opens. I downloaded last week. I've already had to uninstall and redownload twice. When I go to open it, just says can't connect to Nerd Wallet. I'm trying to get organized, not mess with inconsistency. I don't have time for apps that can't run themselves. Can't open app. Works sporadically"
1617,"Downloaded the app, upon linking accounts though it kept giving me an error stating right bank wrong account. Contacted support in regards to this issue. The response I got was that the support representative used the same bank and had no issues. I was asked to attempt logging into my account through a url that was given, if I was able to, the support representative was supposed to escalate the ticket. Well it's been two days since that discussion with out any response from support."
1618,"Although it says it has updated my checking account, the balance has not changed in over a week, even though I have made deposits and withdrawals. It also does not show transactions by account so if you have a charge, you can't see which credit card was used. Pretty weak app."
1619,"Accounts won't link despite multiple attempts. It thinks I have a mortgage even though I just opened that area to see what it was, and won't delete that ""information"" no matter what I try. I'd like to say it was easy to use for other things but it's just clunky."
1620,"Completely useless app. I can't even connect my bank accounts to it, it tells me that some information was incorrect after loading for several minutes. I've tried this with two different bank accounts (three times each) and it continues to give me error messages."
1621,"I used this app to apply for a Capitol One Secured credit card. As per the apps advertisement, you can use it to apply for credit suggested for you and your approval odds. My suggestion was Capitol One secured credit card. I was denied and cost me a point plus another mark on my applied for credit section. This app is a lie and does not help but hurts your credit. DO NOT use!!!"
1622,"Nerd Wallet had a huge issue a long time ago and it bricked my account. ""this phone number was already used"" Error pretty much means the app is now worthless to you. I hope someday they fix this, I guess till then I'll just use something else that isn't broken. Spoke with the tech support, they said to get a new phone."
1623,"WARNING!!!!! Don't wast your time. Once you have verified your phone number, for the first time, you can't get any access to Link any of your account information. Crappy design. ***Update You can Not delete your credit report information or delete/ disable the account!! All information is kept!!!!"
1624,"Accounts dont stay linked. Have to re link all the time. If they send you a confirmation code to your email and you open your email app to get the code, nerdwallet will log you back out and back out of the page you were on so the code they sent is now useless. Not intuitive at all."
1625,"As you can see from so many recent reviews, people cannot link the app to their bank accounts. Without this crucial feature, the app serves no purpose. The developers need to fix this or just take the app down."
1626,Horrible!! Difficult to initiate credit score! I can only imagine how difficult it.would be to incorporate the entire process let alone trying to exit.from the program if that became necessary😑😣😣😥 DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1627,"Keeps freezing. Literally zero usage. I just tried it again for the third time. Don't waste your time. Unstable app. I'm not sure how anything this glitchy can even be secure. If I could do negative stars, I would."
1628,Unable to properly link bank account despite giving all the information required and providing confirmation from my bank. keeps saying I chose the right bank but wrong account even when I try with every account option they provide. app does not provide any link or information on how to contact tech support. just gives links to review or leave feedback for future improvements.
1629,Very annoying problems can't verify id due to phone# error: #already used to verify sms message-tried everything 2 fix-no luck-tried hubby's phone NEW ERROR-NOT VALID US #-WRONG IT IS! VERY FEW THINGS U CAN DO W/O THIS VERIFICATION! WASTED SO MUCH TIME! THEIR OWN FAQS & REVIEWS HERE ALL MENTION SAME PROBLEMS MEANING THEY IGNORE IT/REFUSE TO FIX IT &/OR DONT CARE! I'D DELETE APP BUT I'VE ALREADY SPENT SO MUCH TIME DOING FEW TASKS I COULD W/O VERIFICATION &TRYING TO FIX/RESEARCH ISSUE! GRRRRR
1630,"Look, it's easy to find a 0% I interest credit card. Find one that you transfer your credit card balance onto. They offer like 6 months 0% interest on transfers. Meantime, pay off the card anyway. This brings your principal down. When your time limit is up, transfer again. On direct pay look at the bill. Add to your payment the charge they added for your use of the money. If you have it add an extra $5.00-10.00. This brings down the payments & the next month's interest & improves your credit."
1631,This app doesn't do anything that CreditKarma or Creditwise can't do. I was expecting a way to actually budget and balance my money. It is essentially just a service that shows you credit cards you can easily find on your own. Not worth the app space. Soooorrryyy.
1632,"The app could not find my credit information despite using multiple addresses and a social security number. When I tried to then use the actual NerdWallet website, it locked me out and said I can try to verify my credit information in 30 days. Incredibly disappointing."
1633,"Accounts don't stay linked. Attempts to relink everyday. Does not show accurate statements or account balances even when properly linked. THEN the kicker, bank saying it's possible to have your FDIC insurance revoked due to giving out banking information willingly after asking why they continuously reject the linking of accounts."
1634,"I have two primary checking accounts, both with major banks, and NerdWallet is unable to link one of the two banks. It just says ""We're working on our connection with this bank"" with no indication of when, if ever, I will be able to link my account."
1635,"If you use apps like Venmo, don't even bother with this app. I paid the rent, and my roommate paid me with Venmo. Because of this, Nerdwallet thinks my rent is twice as much, and I made an extra $800 income doing who knows what. Completely throws off the budget. I also frequently pick up the tab and have people pay me with Venmo. Again, I'm a heavy spender, and suddenly have additional minor sources of income."
1636,"Tried linking my bank several times,but said all the info was wrong. Went back to log in manually on my banks' website with the same info, and it works perfectly. Cute idea, but not worth figuring that out."
1637,"Incomplete, the support team assures me they are working on the issue, yet ive had multiple bank accounts for them to try and link that they cant seem to figure out, just feels like fraud at this point. Ive found a much better product that delivers."
1638,"Won't stay linked to my accounts. Won't let me split screen so I can't get the OTP to relink my accounts without a second device. Logs me out unnecessarily often, even though I have biometric security enabled."
1639,"Cannot use the credit portion, it always says, even after waiting quite a while to try again, cannot find your information. Pretty sad."
1640,"This app is for fat people who can't stop eating at unhealthy restaurants. If you are a fat person this is perfect for you. Otherwise you will never save any money. There aren't any local gas stations to choose from to save money at, nor are there any practical locations to choose from for typical day-to-day transactions. This is an utterly useless app, the likes of which I've only seen from Credit Sesame and Credit Karma where the app entices you into credit card offers so they can make residual income and the questions they ask in the information needed are very invasive"
1641,"Shame, this app looks great. Exactly what I was looking for. However, I have tried for the past couple days to link my account and I get the same error and retry linking."
1642,"Wanted to verify my identity with ss# and other information that I never provide on apps to try to get my credit score and there was no option to side step this or skip this process, Uninstaller the app immediately."
1643,"This app is so glitchy freezes when you want to relink an account. It has so much potential, i install it once in a while to check my credit score. But it's kinda un useful."
1644,"I wonderful interface but there are no categories for rent, auto costs, shopping, etc. A tracking app that does not let me track my money is unfortunately useless."
1645,"Horrible! Don't recommend if looking to improve credit or budget. Ever since they switched to using Plaid, linked bank/loan/other accts will show inaccurate amounts, or need to be relinked all over again -and that is if linking accts tool even works that day."
1646,Horrible app! Ive spend 1.5 hrs on multiple occasions updating my 2 banks and all my credit card accounts only to finf they all get deleted or need updates after a day or so. Dont waste your time. Get Credit Karma.
1647,"I just downloaded the app to shop/compare credit cards, and already the marketplace section doesn't work (i.e.: completely blank, won't show me anything). I have to imagine it's a good tool, when it works, but the one function I wanted to use is no-go..."
1648,"Everytime I login there is a new problem with an account needong to ne fixed and then you got through lile 5 steps and it still will not correct the issue. Very annoying, frustrating, time consuming."
1649,"i like the features yes, but on my phone the Card Cleaner App provides a check if medium risk to high risk with option to complete the installation or by proceeding to see why and uninstall .Sooo ! got to say no.thanks plus my banking has similar application.the graph..is ok"
1650,"No option to delete my account with Nerdwallet, they blast me with emails daily. I unsubscribed emails and unsubscribing wasn't a simple user friendly process from the emails they were bombarding me with.."
1651,Nerdwallet's tracking of assets is extremely limited and does not properly connect property values with remaining mortgages. It limits the number of properties one can list to only one property and does not account for other investments that account for true net wealth. It's the absolute worst monitoring device to truly know one's net value and how that factors into purchasing power. I only use this for checking my credit score... nothing more since the rest of the data is completely inadequate.
1652,"I went to download the app on a galaxy s10. The app will not even open. Tells me ""oops"". What do you mean ""oops""? Why is a freshly downloaded app unable to open ? That's just weird."
1653,"I have to manually enter all accounts daily to refresh. Great idea and concepts, but it's so annoying to have to spend hours trying to get the app to work"
1654,"Don't really care much for this app. I can't set up my savings account & instead of letting me put whether bills are paid or not, it automatically assumes they are. It doesn't really budget."
1655,"All this is a bunch of advertisements for big banks and their products. Also, it is only a matter of time before there is a ""breach in security"" and your financial data will be compromised. The financial education is extremely basic and are recurring themes that have been circulating around for decades."
1656,Put in all my info and notification came up saying they could not verify me and and I've been blocked for 30 days. Tried twice just be sure. I've used multiple similar apps without issue. Thumbs down.
1657,Requires credit score checking
1658,I have only had this app for a little over a week and it won't let me log in it keeps telling me it can't connect with nerdwallet and to try again later and I tried later twice and it is saying the same thing
1659,The app keeps crashing after the latest update on my Samsung note 10 . I tried sending feedback still can't look into my savings tab for details from the last 10 days !!
1660,"Good grief! I went to set up an account and get an error that I've already set up an account with my email, so I attempt to login and get an error that no account exists with my email....the same email they claim I opened an account with previously."
1661,After linking social to find out my options for credit cards it wanted my bank account info needlessly. I know it's a reputable site but there is no need to request my login information for my bank account....
1662,"Downloaded it, put my info in and same day Ive gotten log in attempts and my gmails been hacked.. Never had any problems before I download this...so beware!!! No telling who got my dam info SMDH!"
1663,Tried signing in multiple times the last 4 days and it buffers and nothing happens. So I tried a whole new account and the same error repeats when signing in. Uninstalled too many times. Gave up.
1664,Terrible experience never got linking accounts correct after entering right info 50 times and takes forever. Don't recommend there are better apps with less aggregation.
1665,You're looking for loans don't waste your time on this app it doesn't give loans it just generates information for other websites to get your information if you want to waste your time for no reason having an app taking up space on your phone go ahead and download this
1666,Complete disconnect between what they say your score is and what the credit unions say it is ! Stick with the Credit Unions ! They are far more accurate !
1667,Defective. Bank accounts keep unlinking
1668,An application was submitted to a loan company that I never applied for when I set up an acct to prequalify and I hadn't even finished setting up the acct to prequalify...this sucks
1669,I got to the link portion and suddenly the app spazzed and wouldn't let me get past the green N logo. Looked promising but apparently not.
1670,My experian score is 730 The rest are quite a but higher So no I do not particularly like this app.
1671,Used to be fantastic and used to be my absolute favorite credit app to go on and check my credit etc that is up until it stopped letting me log in over a month ago and no matter what I have tried including contacting customer support 4 times they did nothing to help and here we are with all my private personal information out there and I can't access it to even delete my account it's a nightmare
1672,App won't let me link anything so whats the point
1673,"Would have loved to have tried the app as I love the website, but I didn't want to link my credit score as the only goal for the app was easy access to articles and information."
1674,Constantly steals or losses your card and bank info and when asked why they justgive you articles that don't explain why.
1675,"Put in my personal info, handed over my bank user name and password and got nothing in return but the previous screen, started over, got kicked back with nothing to show for it. Need Wallet is collecting personal info and bank acct passwords. Now I have to monitor my bank acct??"
1676,"UNINSTALLING IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY! I was on my way to use this app. In the process of just making my password, I started getting bs errors. Every time I would type the letter I the app would do some bs like (illi okyy). So I'm UNINSTALLING IMMEDIATELY!"
1677,sucks won't let me enter one number
1678,"Too many errors.in such a short time. Tried to set up accounts to no avail kept getting an error oops something went wrong, really? With that said I tried to unlink my accounts again, oops something went wrong I'm scared I gave them way too much of my information I'm probably screwed."
1679,This app sucks. They try helping but if ur checking account is 1500 due to checks not posted yet they suggest putting a bunch in savings. If u do then u overdraft. Then if u suggest 1500 in savings they see 2000 so u should invest 500. My savings is my emergency fund I don't want to risk losing it . If it's tied up in investments how do I get it in am emergency??? Poorly run app. AVOID!!!!!!!
1680,"I'm not interested in my ""debt"" score. I'm more interested in money management with deceasing my debts. How to by pass credit score info...."
1681,"Not nearly as the commercials portray it. Just sends you to web sites, doesn't streamline. No use"
1682,Need to provide SSN before you can see anything
1683,Experiencing difficullties loading
1684,I just wanted something I could track my expenses on. My bank is a small credit union and not on the list so I can't move forward. Garbage.
1685,"Why must I add my bank account information to use this app? I just wanted to see my credit score, and how your app works. No thanks."
1686,Just wanted to see my credit scores and check out the app to see if I wanted to actually use it WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO ADD MY BANK ACCOUNT BEFORE I CAN ACCESS ANYTHING. Not gonna happen. Shady af seems almost like a scam
1687,Won't even let me link my accounts so....pretty pointless....
1688,It will not let me sign into my bank account it keep getting a error message
1689,real nerds have apps that people can use. This is junk.
1690,As usefull as it looks it won't update the money amounts and it's been 2 weeks so now useless
1691,Wanted to much personal and financial info just for you to use the app or even try out the app to see if you want to Assyria use it not everyone is dumb with their money they need someone walking them hand and foot just to find useful financial info
1692,I no more installed this app signed in had forgotten my password and changed it and put in my storage added the Nerdwallet my email & password to it. Went to open the app because I opened a different link sign in again to be told it was either the wrong email and/ or password did it a second time in case and got the same message. I saved my signin info but oviously it was removed. I no longer trust this app. I'm uninstalling and deleting my account.
1693,"Can't use without creating an account, wouldn't let me create one"
1694,"Extremely laggy, & the fact that I have to relink my accounts every other day is irritating. Been using for a couple to few months over the years on & off, love the ability to enter assets."
1695,Defective. Bank accounts keep unlinking
1696,"Too political, very biased."
1697,"Simply wanted to review Credit Cards, but this app requires way too much PII just to access it. Hard pass."
1698,Downloaded couldn't link my bank account couldn't move on. Ttied several days and same message. Would love to use but won't let you pass not sure if its Plaid or what but seems odd that if you don't have a way to move on and try again later and contoniue with the set up.
1699,Stop showing black businesses down my throat pls
1700,Requires credit score checking
1701,Keeps telling me my phone number is not a valid US number. I've had this same number for over 10 years
1702,Can't verified my address - I living 8 y . On the same address!!! Crazy . I can't even sign up!
1703,"App is good idea, but many investment/securities institutions aren't available to link accounts and I have to constantly relink my financial accounts. Not really of use to me. In fact, two of my Financial institutions disappeared from the list of available Banks and had to unlink them."
1704,My score sais 728...i went i to an rv dealership to buy my dream rig and was quickly kicked in the balls when they pulled my score up and there was over 100 difference lower than what this app told me. So im not happy at all. Wby is there succk a large difference from the true number????
1705,"The app is really slow, and gives blank pages a lot. I'd rather just use the website in a browser, at least that works for me. The app is a nice idea, just wish it was fast and worked."
1706,Says that it can connect credit card and bank account data but is unable to connect a citi card. Will only say that I have the right login info but there is no account. Contacted support and still no reply.
1707,Not going to spend 20 minutes scrolling through years so that I can put in my birthday. A lot of people to type it in instead of having to scroll through calendar after calendar. Just deleted the app and didn't even bother using it because of that.
1708,I have credit karma to monitor my credit. Your App is forcing me to link my personal credit information. You're fired before we even get started!!!!!!
1709,Keeps prompting me to link accounts which I have already done and then crashes. Currently a worthless app.
1710,In the beginning I love this app but now it has been crashing 😕 on me!!
1711,After linking social to find out my options for credit cards it wanted my bank account info needlessly. I know it's a reputable site but there is no need to request my login information for my bank account....
1712,"Wanted to verify my identity with ss# and other information that I never provide on apps to try to get my credit score and there was no option to side step this or skip this process, Uninstaller the app immediately."
1713,"Not good, i cant sign up, Puerto Rico is not available on states list."
1714,Will not stay open.
1715,I cant support an app that promotes divide. So tell me how i can use your app to tell the race of a store owner. Thats racist!!!!
1716,Junk
1717,"Does not support VOIP phone lines like Republic Wireless so I can't link any of my accounts. Plenty of apps support VOIP, no reason not to."
1718,Since I have used this app I have experienced a lot of fraud with my personal info. I'm now battling fraud with really high amount of money that was used with my info on this app in states I'm not even in. So do not give any personal information about your self with this app.
1719,It dont add US bank but theres an option for usbank? Like what? Fix this
1720,"Helping the rich get richer., brain washing."
1721,"YOUR APP SUCKS!!! Dispite all is security features using SMS to verify my phone, I discovered the verification code is being sent to the wrong number. I can see the wrong phone number in my profile settings. I tried to enter the correct number but the app says it already has it so it remains unchanged."
1722,Wont help me none no account and no money guess this dont apply for poor people im poor so i dont qualify for anything thanks for nothing just wanted me to instz thir app not right
1723,This app is full of ad . Nothing else and does not create any value . I downloaded it to simulate my credit score but this rubbish app does not have any options to see what will happen if I pay my debt
1724,How do you delete this account? It has nowhere to delete my information so I can delete the app!
1725,Only offers transunion score. Credit Karma at least adds Equifax to the list. If you guys get all 3 big companies I might reinstall.
1726,Doesn't have my credit card lender or loan lender.
1727,I can't link my bank account. The app said my cell number isn't a valid number.
1728,It won't allow me to link multiple accounts (in different names) from the same bank.
1729,never got the money and cant even log in now after updating .
1730,"I want an app that will track my net worth. This one won't let you enter numbers, you have to link accounts. Not what I'm looking for. Also requires Chrome, which I don't use. Bye."
1731,"Look, it's easy to find a 0% I interest credit card. Find one that you transfer your credit card balance onto. They offer like 6 months 0% interest on transfers. Meantime, pay off the card anyway. This brings your principal down. When your time limit is up, transfer again. On direct pay look at the bill. Add to your payment the charge they added for your use of the money. If you have it add an extra $5.00-10.00. This brings down the payments & the next month's interest & improves your credit."
1732,"Accounts won't link despite multiple attempts. It thinks I have a mortgage even though I just opened that area to see what it was, and won't delete that ""information"" no matter what I try. I'd like to say it was easy to use for other things but it's just clunky."
1733,"This app is so glitchy freezes when you want to relink an account. It has so much potential, i install it once in a while to check my credit score. But it's kinda un useful."
1734,"Your app looks great but when tried to build my profile noticed Puerto Rico is not listed in the address section. I totally understand we are just a US territory but at least you can add it, so I had to uninstall it..."
1735,Faulty account linking functionality. Either does not link or requires further verification steps.
1736,"Although it says it has updated my checking account, the balance has not changed in over a week, even though I have made deposits and withdrawals. It also does not show transactions by account so if you have a charge, you can't see which credit card was used. Pretty weak app."
1737,"Horrible! Don't recommend if looking to improve credit or budget. Ever since they switched to using Plaid, linked bank/loan/other accts will show inaccurate amounts, or need to be relinked all over again -and that is if linking accts tool even works that day."
1738,The put things in the wrong category and make your credit look worse than it really is.
1739,Wants a sign up when it's none of your business.
1740,"There's NO doubt that if it weren't for the stupid name, I'd give this five stars! I'm NOT a nerd, but this app is useful!"
1741,"Nerd Wallet had a huge issue a long time ago and it bricked my account. ""this phone number was already used"" Error pretty much means the app is now worthless to you. I hope someday they fix this, I guess till then I'll just use something else that isn't broken. Spoke with the tech support, they said to get a new phone."
1742,Waste of time
1743,Nerdwallet's tracking of assets is extremely limited and does not properly connect property values with remaining mortgages. It limits the number of properties one can list to only one property and does not account for other investments that account for true net wealth. It's the absolute worst monitoring device to truly know one's net value and how that factors into purchasing power. I only use this for checking my credit score... nothing more since the rest of the data is completely inadequate.
1744,"Don't bother, this is just an ad machine. You're better off with Mint or using a bank that has in app aggregation offerings."
1745,It use to work great. I can't connect any of my accounts now. I hope this is fixed soon...
1746,"App closes everytime I click on the credit tab, and thats really the only reason I use it."
1747,Nothing is ever updated and when I complained they said to contact the credit reporting agency. Worthless app.
1748,"Didn't have half of the accounts I use. Couldn't find my bank, which is a FCU. App kept freezing. Would not accept my credentials even though I entered them exactly as though I were paying a bill. Can't verify through fingerprint with bill pay apps you have already verified by fingerprint. I'd rather pay my bills with one app than 15-20 apps. We thought that was what we were getting. We were wrong. Uninstalled within an hour of frustration. No pictures for us!"
1749,"Downloaded it, put my info in and same day Ive gotten log in attempts and my gmails been hacked.. Never had any problems before I download this...so beware!!! No telling who got my dam info SMDH!"
1750,"Can't even do what the app is supposed to do. I set a budget. Link my cards and manually put in bills that aren't part of my cards but after I've marked those bills at paid, it regards them at $0 as if they never existed at all. It's been a whole week since I've reported this and nothing has been done with this app breaking bug. Don't use this app. Literally useless."
1751,Useless app if you don't bank with a huge corporate bank. Smaller credit unions are not even listed and so you don't get the benefit of the service. Also it feels really insecure. Deleted.
1752,"Especially since the update this app is a waste. Every time I try to open it, it says ""Opps! We're having trouble connecting to NerdWallet. Please try again later."" Plus it is extremely annoying if it is past the due date for a bill it gets automatically categorized as paid. I know when the due date is but that doesn't mean that they took the money and that it is actually out of my account already."
1753,Very broken. Couldn't stay connected to Capital One and app wouldn't reopen after a certain point.
1754,Can't connect
1755,"Works ok when it opens. I downloaded last week. I've already had to uninstall and redownload twice. When I go to open it, just says can't connect to Nerd Wallet. I'm trying to get organized, not mess with inconsistency. I don't have time for apps that can't run themselves. Can't open app. Works sporadically"
1756,I have only had this app for a little over a week and it won't let me log in it keeps telling me it can't connect with nerdwallet and to try again later and I tried later twice and it is saying the same thing
1757,Wouldn't connect any of my accounts. Too many attempts. My checking account got locked. Uninstalled.
1758,You're looking for loans don't waste your time on this app it doesn't give loans it just generates information for other websites to get your information if you want to waste your time for no reason having an app taking up space on your phone go ahead and download this
1759,"Not sure what old records this app references, but the credit score it reports is SOO OFF compared to what comes from Transunion, Experian and Equifax. Even my credit card reports a more accurate score. Sorry, but if you can't accurately report someone's score, what else do you have wrong?? Uninstalled."
1760,"Good grief! I went to set up an account and get an error that I've already set up an account with my email, so I attempt to login and get an error that no account exists with my email....the same email they claim I opened an account with previously."
1761,Currently doesn't support capital one bank
1762,Still have an issue with not loading
1763,Looks like good idea. Downloaded. Tried to link first account. Failed because they don't support it. Deleted app.
1764,"Seemed like a good app until I tried to add multiple bank accounts from same institution. If this is you, don't bother."
1765,"Nothing I did worked, so I uninstalled the app. Not worth my time and energy."
1766,I really wanted to use this app. I quit on 2018 due to connectivity issues with Capital One. It's 2 years later and they still haven't found out how to connect with Capital One
1767,"As you can see from so many recent reviews, people cannot link the app to their bank accounts. Without this crucial feature, the app serves no purpose. The developers need to fix this or just take the app down."
1768,"After over a year of using the app it starts slowing at sign in. Then disconnects entirely and makes you sign in again. I'm too busy for this and need an app that actually works when I need it. From other reviews, they are aware of this issue and seem unable or unwilling to fix it. Also, this is not just a 5g issue. Garbage app."
1769,For $129 a year we should get an app not a bad web overlay. Also after the 1st time I drag an item to a spot on the budget it should remember where it goes moving forward. Dave's program is good this money grab scam isn't.
1770,"It won't let me sign in, despite having an account. It also won't let me sign up. It keeps saying I need to check my internet connection, which is fine. I even disconnected wifi... same problem. I tried to use the website, but after you log in, it won't let you do anything until you download the app... vicious circle."
1771,Unable to use this App. It keeps telling me to check my internet connection. All my other apps work on my phone. Everything on my phone has no issues with the internet via wifi or my data plan. I even tried Uninstalling and reinstalling twice. Guess it wasn't meant to be.
1772,If the app can keep me from dealing with the same transaction multiple times (sometimes 3 or 4) it would be great. But I lose a lot of time having to double check and see if a transaction is duplicate or not. But I'm confident that the Dave Ramsey Team can figure this out. I BELIEVE! 😊
1773,I get this message every time I try to sign in to the app: We weren't able to sign you in. Please check your network connection and try again. I have a paid membership to Ramsey+ and hope this can get sorted out soon.
1774,The app stopped connecting to my bank. Customer service is great at responding and working on it but the solution was to still have to reconnect everytime I open the app. Super time consuming. Now a new bank connection process appeared and it won't connect to my bank again. This app is too expensive to not work as described. Too bad because it is so helpful when it was working properly.
1775,"I've used the app for a long time and suddenly i cannot log in no matter how much i uninstall and reinstall, change my network or anything. It is extremely annoying."
1776,The app does not load. Every time I try to sign in (or even sign up) I get a network connection error. I have a Samsung Galaxy 10.
1777,"Duplicate and missing transactions all the time. When you have an issue, the technical team is always asking you stupid questions to make you lose time and in the end they never resolve it, again NEVER! Is always the banks, you, the, E.T, the dog, but never them. I have been 3 years with this app because I did the David Ramsey course and I had some extra trust, but I am searching a new one. 3 years of nightmare having to check all transactions one by one."
1778,"No longer works. All it does is ""load"" tried different things. It's frustrating. Never loads."
1779,"""Sign up it's Free"" then want cardio info and trial after they waste your time getting all your info. Just wanted a simple budget calculator not a bait and switch ad!!!"
1780,Constant bugs I have to un link my account constantly and it still doesn't work. $130.00 for a budget app that doesn't work is not in my budget.(pardon the punn). Please make my $130.00 app purchase worth it.
1781,All the sudden you can't login in anymore via the mobile app. Pretty annoying.
1782,No longer works! Keep getting a cannot connect message. I have a Samsung.
1783,Not able to login. Getting error message of check your network
1784,New sign up is awful. Will not take your correct email only old accounts
1785,"Great app, when it works (seriously, it is fantastic, but it's unstable). I use the paid version and have had persistent bank synchronization and duplicate transaction issues that the support team seems uninterested in fixing. I last had this issue in June 2020 and it's already back in February 2021. I give the team credit for reaching out to me, but their bottom line was ""...we hope to work on [it] this year..."". That's a big problem when this duplicate issue is an annual event."
1786,I used app for over a year and it was GREAT! Recently it stopped working properly. When I put in info then go to put information elsewhere in the app it deletes all previous information. Putting me back at square one with no info for the month. I hate that it does work anymore.
1787,"I am unable to log in. It keeps saying ""We weren't able to sign you in. Please check your network connection and try again."" Galaxy S7. Android 8.0. My connection is obviously just fine. (Wi-Fi) Thanks guys, I'm sure you can fix it. Go Android Studio!"
1788,I have reset my password and still can not get the app to load. As soon as I am logged in a screen appears asking me to create an account or sign out. If I select create an account Im told that the app has lost its connection. This is horrible
1789,"I would love to rate this app higher but I can't. I am trying to climb my way out of debt, not create more and this app is super expensive to use the paid version! I MAY break down and pay to use this app and if I do, I will possibly change my rating. I just find it hard to pay so much to use a budgeting tool while trying to pay off debt."
1790,"Overpriced. Duplicates every transaction from my bank no matter what I do (tried disconnecting and reconnecting to bank account, uninstalling and reinstalling app...no luck)"
1791,Wanted to try this app again now that I understand my budget better and the dang thing won't log me in. It just keeps taking me back to the login page. I already reset my password and tried restarting my phone but no luck.
1792,"The app will not let me log in or create an account. A ""check network connection"" message pops up and I've tried it on both cellular network and wifi and no luck with either. I really want to use this budget app. Please help."
1793,I can't use it. Says my email is already registered but refuses to let me reset my password. Just a constant loop.
1794,Requires you to accept terms of service for Google Chrome in order you to use the app. I simply refuse to accept those terms. Guess I'll be finding a different tool. Very unfortunate.
1795,I signed up for the 14 day trial and was charged the annual fee already. It's only been 1 day since I signed up.
1796,App never worked for me. It just loads after making an acct. Uninstalled.
1797,"Terrible app for tracking spending. The app kept duplicating both credits and debits from my checking account, some more than a dozen times! I reached out to customer service with my issues but no resolution was offered. I'm glad I was able to delete before forking over more than $100 for useless junk. I hope someone reaches out when this problem is resolved, because I really trust the Ramsey name and really wanted the app to be functional."
1798,"No experience at all, because I couldn't figure out how to get past the create password. I had all the combinations it asked for but kept saying bad request please correct indicated fieds,but fails to indicate where those fields were. Back to the delete files you go!!!!"
1799,Better free apps out there. Signed up for the pay one and now I can't cancel it. Ramsey should do better. Update it's now 2021 they told me my subscription was cancelled but now it's charging my card again. What a scam.
1800,"I thought getting the paid version would make it easier to manage but it won't sync properly. Even though the app puts my savings in automatically for the budget it won't sync up and match what my actual balance is in my bank account. It's been doing that for 3 months now. At one point I thought my bank account was hacked but then the money that was ""missing"" was my savings. Really weird. Don't like it."
1801,Can't login
1802,"Terrible, when you sign up for free trial it says we would notified in advance before the charge, no notification just took the money. It's all I had in my account. I wasn't happy with the app because it kept having connectivity issues with my back so my balances were never accurate and that's the only reason I chose it 😭. I lost huge with this app"
1803,"Install app, signed up, spent 15 minutes setting it up. Then uninstall after finding out they charge $125 a year for extra options. One of the extra options that should I feel should be free was have your bank account link. Mint have this options without paying for it. I have no idea why this app has over 4.5 star, am I missing something? Anyways that my grips on it."
1804,Absolutely my favorite budgeting app!!! EXCEPT the third party used to connect to banks does not have a consistent connection with Venmo. It does not transfer merchant information and You have to connect a couple of times before the transactions come through. AND ALSO MY CHASE ACCT has constant connectivity issues as well. I hate Mint interface but I have none of these issues over there
1805,"After you sign up and attempt to sign in to the app it bounces you to a company website.. Where you there to sign up... In other words this ""app"" is actually click bait for their website to try and sell you additional services. Nice to see Ramsey has turned to the dark side"
1806,"The app crashes in the log in page everytime, when I can get in I love it, but...I cant get logged in"
1807,"Incomplete at best. I would have expected a lot more features and capabilities. The pricing doesn't make sense (annual subscription is $10 more than 12 month's worth of monthly subscriptions), you have to upgrade to Plus in order to link bank accounts. Can't transfer money between accounts/expenses that are linked to show payments to credit cards/savings. Can't delete your account without having to contact the support team. Not worth the price tag in my opinion and manual entry isn't practical."
1808,If we forget to switch the month and enter the transaction for the next month it still leaves it in the preceding months budget. This is a feature that needs to be changed because it causes a lot of extra work. Or at least give us the option to switch the month with a pulldown menu rather than having to delete all the transactions out of one month and move them to the next one. The huge + blocks the $ amounts in the list.
1809,"It appeared this app would be a straight forward user-friendly app to help me in the new year do a better job with our finances. Maybe It's just me but I can't figure out how to enter the basic info like planned income and planned expense. The tutorial goes through the how to, BUT my screen looks nothing like the tutorial and does not have the same options and buttons to click on, so the how to tutorial is useless to me since I can't mimic it to what I see on my installed app. Frustrating!!!!!!!!"
1810,"We are canceling our subscription. (1) as other users said, the syncing with the bank is very glitchy (2) in the last year, there have been a total of 8 weeks where it wouldn't sync with the bank at all. (3) when it was down for 5-6 weeks in the spring, the support team said they would add 6 weeks to my membership. (4) they did not (5) it has been down another 2-3 weeks and (6) support team denies they ever agreed to lengthen my membership. **I paid to have it sync with my bank, but it won't**"
1811,"No option to upload a file of the transactions from my bank! I understand they can't support every little credit union, but an option to upload a .csv, ofx, qfx, or a .qbo would cover that."
1812,"The spending categories are not how I divide out my money and couldn't change them to fit me. Also had a lot of problems each time I opened the app, had to restart it a lot, and got a message ""tag not supported"" when I made adjustments to my budget. Not impressed with plus either. I have privacy concerns with Ramsey Soultions having my bank account data. Went back to using a spreadsheet on my laptop."
1813,"It was working alright, doing what i needed. I wished they had a better fund building feature that wasn't just another section to add or subtract from my budget. Anyway, the app keeps signing me out with an ""authentication error"" and my password isn't working. I'm just deleting and getting a new app, too many problems just to calculate my bills."
1814,"The original app is great.  When I upgraded to the paid app I  couldn't sync with my bank.   I left my phone number, and the app said someone would help within 48 hours.  One month later the free trial is over,  and I was charged $9.99.  I can't find a way to request a refund for an app I can't use.  I also didn't do anything to make sure I didn't get charged, so maybe a little ""stupid tax"" on my part as well.  Just warning others to be cautious if you find yourself in the same situation."
1815,"Raised the price of the plus feature from $99 to $130 for a year and removed the monthly option. The reason they give is they now include a financial class that we neither want nor need. Definitely not just because ""the banks charge us a fee, so we pass that on to you"" like Dave says... Switching over to YNAB. Update - after switching to YNAB I found the app had not been tracking transactions in funds correctly. I was off by $600 after 1 year. :-("
1816,"Don't get the plus version app is a scam!!! For some reason they have problems with several banks and the transactions are not being linked. If your bank is one of those you will lose your money because they will keep it. And horrible customer service they say they get back to you in 24 hours, yes that was las t week still waiting. They keep getting rich stealing peoples money. Such a disapointment."
1817,"Definitely NOT worth the cost for the full features offered with the subscription. This app has a bug where your transactions from your bank account sync multiple times, requiring lots of maintenance to delete transactions in order to have the correct info. And then they all just sync AGAIN. I haven't been using the app in months because of this bug. The free option is fine, you just have to enter everything manually, which could also be a lot of work."
1818,"Helpful in theory, worthless in execution. While this app is a great idea and could be helpful, it's so full of bugs that it's practically useless. If you want to link a bank account to it so you don't have to manually input every transaction, you'll find yourself constantly fighting with it and dealing with the less than helpful support staff The budget portion works sometimes, but still fails to copy items over. Maybe with some extensive bug fixes, this app would be worth it."
1819,"Disappointing. The app redirects to the website often which is frustrating. I spent a great deal of time entering my bills and a few minutes later half of them were gone and $587 was returned to my budget (I wish those bills WOULD disappear but yeah, no). And of COURSE it really, REALLY wants me to upgrade (y'all, if I could afford almost $200 for a premium upgrade I probably wouldn't be looking for a way to get my finances in order!)"
1820,Continuously have to sync my bank accounts. 1 of my accounts (citibank) has not linked or synced in months even after several attempts on a desktop and through the app. The transactions also take days to show up even after they are posted to my bank account. The balance feature is almost always wrong. This app has a good concept but the account syncing needs serious work.
1821,Very basic functionality. There is no way to see monthly or yearly averages. The credit car and bank account syncing is very hit or miss. It works sometimes and not others. I often end up with duplicate entries. Anything with 2 factor authentication does not sync well at all. And some credit cards are not supported. I end up exporting all the data to excell to get monthly averages. I am going to give up and do all the tracking in excel since this app wastes more time than it saves.
1822,We have been using this app for several months. We have a subscription so it should sync with our bank. We have not been able to sync since the end of June. We have been back and forth with customer service and been advised that it is being worked on. Even did some attempts to connect so that they could trace the problem. I have been following up every week since I do not hear from them. Very frustrating to say the least. Over 2 months without being able to connect. Would not recommend.
1823,"Much like other reviewers, I am extremely disappointed with how Everydollar has gone downhill. Can't connect to the bank, then it reconnects at some point and downloads doubles of all your transactions, giving you the huge task of sorting transactions you thought were already categorized and manually deleting doubles. Also some random transactions are still missing! Everydollar USED TO BE GOOD which is why this is so frustrating. It's basically unusable at this point. Does Dave know about this??"
1824,"About a day after the free trial ended I tried to call and cancel my subscription. I did not find myself using it, nor was it user friendly. I left a message with the every dollar app dept., because I was immediately charged $129.99 for the whole year. I was unaware that this would happen. You should let it be known that the app will charge you up front for the whole year. I thought it was a monthly charge. I am very unhappy and disappointed! Not cool Dave!"
1825,"App is pretty good, but the ""Plus"" service doesn't work reliably with my bank, causing all kinds of errors and making budgeting very difficult. Asked for a refund because of how badly it had performed over the course of the year, support denied my request because it was outside of their 30-day return window... it worked okay at first but after the first month it was terrible! Very sad that they wouldn't help me out, as my financial situation has been tough this past year. Did more harm than good"
1826,"App works most of the time. Sometimes it won't open. The functionality of the budget is great. There is no customer service. I was charged for the app because of automatic renewal. I did not realize this happened, and unfortunately, this issue is hard to resolve if you are lucky enough to find someone to talk to. I would suggest not to get the everydollar plus unless you want to pay nearly $10 a month. Not worth it."
1827,"Stupid app. Dont even know where to begin on how much simpler this could be. Biggest issue for me is that I cant move excess money to other catagories/debts very easily. Excel is 10× better and easier. I can add or move anything i choose any time. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND ESPECIALLY YOUR MONEY. Read through the reviews. Most of the responses from Ramsey is a generic line saying ""email help@blahblah"" REALLY!! Your a scammer amd only in it for the money. Tell everyone the truth Dave. $$$$$"
1828,"Great idea behind the app but the functionality of syncing to your bank account is very buggy. I often have to wait up to almost 24 hours to see previous business day transactions show up in the app. The syncing between the app and bank account does not happen first thing in the morning, rather it appears to happen at random times every day. I don't think the app is worth the yearly expense due to how buggy it is. Requesting help through app also apparently doesn't get sent to the team"
1829,"Hated it. I started with MS Money in 2000, but now use Quicken 2014. This app doesn't track taxes, paychecks every other week, interest, etc. It was not helpful during set-up to be taken to a browser instead of the app. There is no ""close account"" link in the app that I can see. There is no way to easily set up short term payments. If you're a Quicken or Money user, keep looking. This is child's play."
1830,"free version is easy to use for everyday budgeting. customize your line items and set your personal values. BUT, the PAID version is TERRIBLE, it can take several days for bank to sync to this app. The app is always several days behind my bank acc. The only good thing about the paid version is that it comes with FPU. Beware once you get the PAID app, you pay for the whole year in one chunk. Update 4/2/2020: paid version still sucks. It is takes days to sync. I tried numerous things to fix."
1831,"If I could give this app a negative mark I would, I read reviews about it crashing constantly but I still decided to give it a try. The 1st item I added to my grocery list, when I decided to reviews the items I couldn't scroll down, then the app crashed. I tried this 3 times and still got the same issue so I decided to cancel my free trial, no point in trying something free if it's going to give you a headache."
1832,"After reading the user guide line, I could never get my financial information to be reflected in the app. The app would allow me to enter numerical values and those entries could be dropped into the appropriate category, but not a single dollar amount has ever been reflected in the overall financial statement. What good is this? Your Ramsey Solutions reply is completely inappropriate. I need feedback in real time. I don't need a delayed email that cannot directly address the issue I am having with this application. After-the-fact support does not get this app working correctly. You need an option for real-time support. You fail."
1833,"DO NOT waste your time or money on the paid app. You will still have to manually put in all transactions in order for them to be up to date since they don't log any transactions unless they've cleared. And over 50% of them will simply read electronic debit. In response to my response I reached out to the support team before I ever posted my review. They told me I could not recieve a refund, not even a partial one and for the app to do what I need it to I would need to log on through a computer."
1834,"Terrible app. Between my savings, income and spent, I cannot reconcile this budget. I added all transactions manually (using the free version) from my account for the month and somehow I am over $700 which is not accurate. So far I have found no way to make eveything line up. Advertised as an easy way to make a budget and this app is anything but easy."
1835,This is a glorified notepad. All it does is ask you what you want to do with your budget then YOU insert your pay each time you're paid and YOU write in how much you spent on each of the categories then the app tells you how much you have left. Simple addition and subtraction what a concept. The exact same thing can be accomplished with the calculator and notes apps built into your phone.
1836,"Not user friendly or intuitive. Upon downloading, installing and opening app, signing in (or registering), the user is greeted to a screen that wants you to make a budget. I thought everydollar might help me make a wise budget by walking me through, wizard step by step style, what I owe, and who I need to pay in order of importance. Didn't waste my time, looks like just another budget tool, which are already in abundance. I need a get out of debt budget tool."
1837,"Waste of money. It worked seamlessly for the first month and now it does not sync with my bank unless i sign out, uninstall the app, sign back in, and put in a new security code every time. And now this week, even that doesnt work. The app freezes and stops working. Ive emailed the Ramsey solutions people and they flat out refuse to refund me my money. Update: Still a waste of money! Now my transactions sync again but 3x per one! So I get to manually delete 2/3 of the transactions! Yay me!"
1838,Since the app updated on 2/10 my transactions are not pulling from my bank. I paid for pro almost 1 year ago and it has worked well until this update. I will not be renewing my pro membership in a few weeks when my 1 year is up. I have to manually enter all transactions for 2 weeks now since it has stopped pulling from my bank. I have verified security/log in/bank passwords/etc multiple times to fix this and all prompts that have been asked of me and still nothing.
1839,Does not sync properly with my bank. I get duplicate and sometimes even more transactions which makes it very messy to track things. Im working with their support currently but it isnt looking good. I like Dave Ramsey and his teachings and have even taught a class but this is very disappointing. If we could get the software to work id be satisfied but they dont seem to want to work very hard to resolve this issue. Ill update my review if this becomes resolved. Otherwise id recommend staying away.
1840,I find it very difficult to use with sinking funds. We have lots and i need an easy way to say i am adding $100 this month but i also plan to spend $40 but I'm not adding $140... I am technically only adding $60. It is also difficult to move money into a different category when you dont spend it all. I am trying to use it because i am a finacial coach but it is just making me frustrated. Why would i recommend this to anyone?
1841,"So far.. I am not liking this app!! I've had items clear/post to my bank account, but the app isn't sinking with them at all. I also do not understand why the items have to clear your account first. I want to know what I have spent money on before it clears my account. I will more than likely be canceling my ""subscription"" and deleting this app."
1842,"Every Glitch would be a better name for this app. I made several attempts to sign up and in w/no success. Each attempt I made I kept getting a mssg that the email was already registered, and then prompted to reset via the email on file. This went back & forth until I just decided to re-register w/a different em. Same mssg, which is totally WHACK, because I just created this new em and no websites I use have that one. Signed Money Can't Buy Me Love 4 This app Pun Intended!"
1843,"I didn't find the app to be anything more than a waste of time putting numbers in boxes. There was no guidance, no suggestions, no nothing. Now I have been charged and I will be Uninstaller an app that was a very expensive poc. My brother told me that Dave figured out how to keep money by making sure people like me leep buying his stuff in layers. I believe he's right."
1844,This app completely sucks and does not pull bank transactions. it just seems funny that it seems to work fine for your 14-day trial then all of the sudden after they charge me full price then I can't seem to get one full month of transactions to pull without contacting customer service. today is December 7th I have not had any transaction pulled onto my account since November 22nd. second time I have had to contact customer service for the same issue and of course there is no refunds.
1845,"They advertise the best FREE app, but in fact you get 15 free days then it's $129 yearly to even add your bank account. Not worth it, unless you have the money for a budgeting app that helps you save, don't bother getting this. Also if you have made an account and don't want it after finding out how much they want, you have to email them saying you want you account deleted, no way of you doing it yourself ""yet"" as they say."
1846,"Cant Cancel!! I signed up for the free trial. I have been trying to figure out how to cancel it!!! Maybe Im missing something,but its REALLY aggravating to be charged $140 for an app thats NOT worth it and not even be able to cancel. So now they have my money and I cant even prevent the next YEAR suvscrubtion from being pulled all at once! EDIT FOR UPDATE: I emailed support to explain the issue and they cancelled it, refunded me and asked for feedback on why I wanted to cancel. Thank you."
1847,Every transaction from my bank comes through multiple times and I have to sort through that mess. I contacted customer support and was told that it's because my bank clears a single transaction several time but their third-party imports every transaction from my banks. They're aware of the issue but unable to fix it. They're also apparently unable to refund my purchase.
1848,This app worked nice. I have had it for 5 months and then all of a sudden it logged me out and won't let me log back in because it says my account has been deleted. I didn't delete my account and I'm not making another one. I'm moving on to another app. I contacted support a week ago and no response. You had your chance. Goodbye!!
1849,"Be sure you want this. Know like you know. If it is day 31, and you dont like it or it doesn't work well for you. You are out of luck getting back the $119.16 you wasted (the prepaid cost for 12 months save 1). In the end, they will tell you that YOU have to take ownership of the fact that you didnt ask for a refund and ""You couldnt take an iPhone back after 30 days."" I could however sell a phone on eBay, which I cant do with this prepaid year of app. Buyer beware, you pay a YEAR up front."
1850,What?! What happened to the monthly 9.99 subscription?! There's no way I can handle a lump sum of 129 for a one time payment even if it IS once a year. That is over half my take home weekly pay. Uninstalling. I'm crushed. I used to love this app.
1851,"AVOID. Paid $130 for Every Dollar +it is a total RIP off. App used to sync with my bank, now it doesn't. Their engineers have been ""working on it"" for 4 weeks. Dave would be disappointed with the customer service we received. Paid for it, can't use it, but no refund."
1852,"The app would be so much better if not flawless if it would actually pull in transactions from all of my accounts. I bank at numerous banks and have a few credit cards I use at the banks and the transactions on a couple of cards do not get pulled in. kind of hard to track/budget ""every dollar"" if they are not all pulled I to the app. uninstalling and reinstalling hasn't helped. Transaction pull in fine on free alternatives like Mint. **UPDATE** I have uninstalled it. wish I could get my $130 back"
1853,I was excited w the idea and set up was easy but I can't sign in anymore. Submitted request for help to no avail. The time to set up is quite a but but worth what the app is supposed to provide but if I can't get in then the set up was a huge waste of time. Disappointing because I am a big fan of all things Ramsey.
1854,"For the past several months, the app makes me reconnect my bank information several times a week. I've asked for help several times, but it feels like I get excuses and the issue is never actually fixed (bc it's apparently the company they use to connect the bank information or the bank). Do not purchase."
1855,"The app provides great information if all you care about is what you planned to spend vs what actually spend. Maybe I have to spend more time defining our families expenses to get the best use of it however, my wife and I feel we could create something better sorted to our needs using Excel. Calling this week to see if we can get a refund or credit towards another product."
1856,I had this app for a year and I just couldn't take it anymore. It is a great idea but the app feels so outdated. It crashed a lot both on my iphone and android. It constantly signed me out. I finally deleted it and switched to money manager with has been amazing.
1857,Doesn't work I have an s20+ and after creating an account it immediately goes to sign out or create account nothing is on the screen. It will signout and kick you out of the app or make you have an endless loop of trying to create an account over and over. Nothing is in my email with account info either. Tried uninstalling multiple times nothing....
1858,"Am a Ramsey solutions subscriber via my primary email but refuses to let me login via that one. I created a new email and made a new account and am now receiving the same error. My email needs verified and I should check my inbox for further solutions. However, I never receive the more information. Literally can't use the app. Will change review once fixed."
1859,My one star rating is not on the free version but on the useless 130 dollar paid version. It constantly delete my bank from the app without me actually doing it. Then it never can find my bank to once again start tracking my expenses. Never and I repeat never upgrade to the paid version you will just be out your money and lead to frustration!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1860,I tried this app after being recommended it by some of my family members. I did the free version seeing if i could see where all of my expenses went during a month. This app is sooo flippin confusing. I seriously would have to input the same information 3 different times before it would register anything. Don't even get me started on all the force closed or force stops which made this app pretty much a pain to use.
1861,"Downloaded the app. I've tried opening the app after making an account and it tells me to ""download the app"" everytime I log in. When I click on this only option, it brings me here. Which it shows that I've already downloaded it. Once I click open, it takes me to the same page and makes me keep doing the continuous loop. Very annoying!"
1862,"I really enjoyed the app at first, but one week in it completely stopped tracking all my expenses. I really don't have the time to enter them all in every single day, the tracking portion of the app was the reason I got it in the first place and paid for an upgrade. so far I am not liking this app."
1863,No tutorials. Doesn't make sense. When you're in a tab and go to add a number it takes you to a different tab thus editing that number and messing everything up. Easier to just get a pen and paper and write everything down. This was made my a guy who just knows how to sell stuff on the radio.
1864,I installed the app and set up an account but every time I sign in it gives me an error message to either sign in or create an account. Goes back to the main screen and does it all over again. I uninstalled and tried again only to get the same. App isn't worth my time to mess with in my opinion.
1865,"Need Option To Remove Categories. I have no debt, medical, charity, fitness, etc. bills in my budget , yet I have to scroll through these premade categories that are deeply embedded and unchangeable. also please allow removal of the favorite expenses list if we have no use for it. I should be able to rearaange my budget categories in a way that fits my person view of their importance. also 10 bucks a month is a bit much for a budgeting app. I mean isn't the entire goal to save money? RIP NETFLIX"
1866,"Transactions are several days behind. I constantly have to reconnect bank accounts and lately I can't do that from my phone. The free version is ok for making a zero based budget, but don't pay for this app to track expenses."
1867,I wanted to like this app. I needed something to help me budget a little bit better. However it doesn't always work and then it logs me out and I have issues logging back in. At this point its more of a hassle then helpful.
1868,For $129 a year we should get an app not a bad web overlay. Also after the 1st time I drag an item to a spot on the budget it should remember where it goes moving forward. Dave's program is good this money grab scam isn't.
1869,"After over a year of using the app it starts slowing at sign in. Then disconnects entirely and makes you sign in again. I'm too busy for this and need an app that actually works when I need it. From other reviews, they are aware of this issue and seem unable or unwilling to fix it. Also, this is not just a 5g issue. Garbage app."
1870,Better free apps out there. Signed up for the pay one and now I can't cancel it. Ramsey should do better. Update it's now 2021 they told me my subscription was cancelled but now it's charging my card again. What a scam.
1871,$129 a year lol
1872,Unable to use this App. It keeps telling me to check my internet connection. All my other apps work on my phone. Everything on my phone has no issues with the internet via wifi or my data plan. I even tried Uninstalling and reinstalling twice. Guess it wasn't meant to be.
1873,"It won't let me sign in, despite having an account. It also won't let me sign up. It keeps saying I need to check my internet connection, which is fine. I even disconnected wifi... same problem. I tried to use the website, but after you log in, it won't let you do anything until you download the app... vicious circle."
1874,Can't login
1875,No longer works! Keep getting a cannot connect message. I have a Samsung.
1876,Not able to login. Getting error message of check your network
1877,All the sudden you can't login in anymore via the mobile app. Pretty annoying.
1878,The app does not load. Every time I try to sign in (or even sign up) I get a network connection error. I have a Samsung Galaxy 10.
1879,I get this message every time I try to sign in to the app: We weren't able to sign you in. Please check your network connection and try again. I have a paid membership to Ramsey+ and hope this can get sorted out soon.
1880,"I've used the app for a long time and suddenly i cannot log in no matter how much i uninstall and reinstall, change my network or anything. It is extremely annoying."
1881,Can't seem to edit anything
1882,Constant bugs I have to un link my account constantly and it still doesn't work. $130.00 for a budget app that doesn't work is not in my budget.(pardon the punn). Please make my $130.00 app purchase worth it.
1883,If the app can keep me from dealing with the same transaction multiple times (sometimes 3 or 4) it would be great. But I lose a lot of time having to double check and see if a transaction is duplicate or not. But I'm confident that the Dave Ramsey Team can figure this out. I BELIEVE! 😊
1884,"No longer works. All it does is ""load"" tried different things. It's frustrating. Never loads."
1885,"""Sign up it's Free"" then want cardio info and trial after they waste your time getting all your info. Just wanted a simple budget calculator not a bait and switch ad!!!"
1886,Really need the MONEY COACHING!!! BUT CHARGING?! :(
1887,Too complex
1888,The app stopped connecting to my bank. Customer service is great at responding and working on it but the solution was to still have to reconnect everytime I open the app. Super time consuming. Now a new bank connection process appeared and it won't connect to my bank again. This app is too expensive to not work as described. Too bad because it is so helpful when it was working properly.
1889,Won't let me link accounts. Paid for this & unhappy
1890,"Duplicate and missing transactions all the time. When you have an issue, the technical team is always asking you stupid questions to make you lose time and in the end they never resolve it, again NEVER! Is always the banks, you, the, E.T, the dog, but never them. I have been 3 years with this app because I did the David Ramsey course and I had some extra trust, but I am searching a new one. 3 years of nightmare having to check all transactions one by one."
1891,"No experience at all, because I couldn't figure out how to get past the create password. I had all the combinations it asked for but kept saying bad request please correct indicated fieds,but fails to indicate where those fields were. Back to the delete files you go!!!!"
1892,New sign up is awful. Will not take your correct email only old accounts
1893,"Terrible app for tracking spending. The app kept duplicating both credits and debits from my checking account, some more than a dozen times! I reached out to customer service with my issues but no resolution was offered. I'm glad I was able to delete before forking over more than $100 for useless junk. I hope someone reaches out when this problem is resolved, because I really trust the Ramsey name and really wanted the app to be functional."
1894,Won't open
1895,No bank sync
1896,To hard to figure out no time
1897,"Based on our economic that only work for people who have lots of spared cash, like the guys that sell you get rich quick scams"
1898,"The app crashes in the log in page everytime, when I can get in I love it, but...I cant get logged in"
1899,App never worked for me. It just loads after making an acct. Uninstalled.
1900,You can't link your bank account unless you pay an absurd premium of $130/year.
1901,Requires you to accept terms of service for Google Chrome in order you to use the app. I simply refuse to accept those terms. Guess I'll be finding a different tool. Very unfortunate.
1902,"The app will not let me log in or create an account. A ""check network connection"" message pops up and I've tried it on both cellular network and wifi and no luck with either. I really want to use this budget app. Please help."
1903,"No option to upload a file of the transactions from my bank! I understand they can't support every little credit union, but an option to upload a .csv, ofx, qfx, or a .qbo would cover that."
1904,"Terrible, when you sign up for free trial it says we would notified in advance before the charge, no notification just took the money. It's all I had in my account. I wasn't happy with the app because it kept having connectivity issues with my back so my balances were never accurate and that's the only reason I chose it 😭. I lost huge with this app"
1905,Became to expensive for me.
1906,"Overpriced. Duplicates every transaction from my bank no matter what I do (tried disconnecting and reconnecting to bank account, uninstalling and reinstalling app...no luck)"
1907,I signed up for the 14 day trial and was charged the annual fee already. It's only been 1 day since I signed up.
1908,I used app for over a year and it was GREAT! Recently it stopped working properly. When I put in info then go to put information elsewhere in the app it deletes all previous information. Putting me back at square one with no info for the month. I hate that it does work anymore.
1909,ITS A SCAM AND RELLY BAD!!!!!!!!
1910,Wanted to try this app again now that I understand my budget better and the dang thing won't log me in. It just keeps taking me back to the login page. I already reset my password and tried restarting my phone but no luck.
1911,This is a pain in the a$$ why does it need all of my personal info just so i can input my budget???
1912,I have reset my password and still can not get the app to load. As soon as I am logged in a screen appears asking me to create an account or sign out. If I select create an account Im told that the app has lost its connection. This is horrible
1913,"I would love to rate this app higher but I can't. I am trying to climb my way out of debt, not create more and this app is super expensive to use the paid version! I MAY break down and pay to use this app and if I do, I will possibly change my rating. I just find it hard to pay so much to use a budgeting tool while trying to pay off debt."
1914,"500 error. Nothing will open, then says to go to home page. Stuck in vicious circle"
1915,Fidelity Credit Card syncing does not work. Has been out for several months and support can't tell me when or if it will get resolved.
1916,Won't let me sign up
1917,Very frustrating to use.
1918,"The app is having difficulty logging into my account, and I tried reseting my password but that doesn't even work."
1919,"Great app, when it works (seriously, it is fantastic, but it's unstable). I use the paid version and have had persistent bank synchronization and duplicate transaction issues that the support team seems uninterested in fixing. I last had this issue in June 2020 and it's already back in February 2021. I give the team credit for reaching out to me, but their bottom line was ""...we hope to work on [it] this year..."". That's a big problem when this duplicate issue is an annual event."
1920,I can't use it. Says my email is already registered but refuses to let me reset my password. Just a constant loop.
1921,I could not connect my bank.
1922,The app stopped working.
1923,I can't stand companies that force you to make a ridiculous password but you're never going to remember. Uninstalled right away before even completing my account.
1924,"Install app, signed up, spent 15 minutes setting it up. Then uninstall after finding out they charge $125 a year for extra options. One of the extra options that should I feel should be free was have your bank account link. Mint have this options without paying for it. I have no idea why this app has over 4.5 star, am I missing something? Anyways that my grips on it."
1925,$130 per year? Please. You taught me better than that.
1926,"Stopped working with my bank, and your support rep wasn't interested in finding a fix - just offered to cancel my account. So I did! Sorry Dave, I was a customer since day 1 of Android, but I won't stick around to be treated like that."
1927,"I thought getting the paid version would make it easier to manage but it won't sync properly. Even though the app puts my savings in automatically for the budget it won't sync up and match what my actual balance is in my bank account. It's been doing that for 3 months now. At one point I thought my bank account was hacked but then the money that was ""missing"" was my savings. Really weird. Don't like it."
1928,"I am unable to log in. It keeps saying ""We weren't able to sign you in. Please check your network connection and try again."" Galaxy S7. Android 8.0. My connection is obviously just fine. (Wi-Fi) Thanks guys, I'm sure you can fix it. Go Android Studio!"
1929,Can't sign in
1930,"After you sign up and attempt to sign in to the app it bounces you to a company website.. Where you there to sign up... In other words this ""app"" is actually click bait for their website to try and sell you additional services. Nice to see Ramsey has turned to the dark side"
1931,"Not a easy app to work wont let you change due dates, add income etc"
1932,Absolutely my favorite budgeting app!!! EXCEPT the third party used to connect to banks does not have a consistent connection with Venmo. It does not transfer merchant information and You have to connect a couple of times before the transactions come through. AND ALSO MY CHASE ACCT has constant connectivity issues as well. I hate Mint interface but I have none of these issues over there
1933,It keeps showing 1 transaction 3 separate times
1934,"App is pretty good, but the ""Plus"" service doesn't work reliably with my bank, causing all kinds of errors and making budgeting very difficult. Asked for a refund because of how badly it had performed over the course of the year, support denied my request because it was outside of their 30-day return window... it worked okay at first but after the first month it was terrible! Very sad that they wouldn't help me out, as my financial situation has been tough this past year. Did more harm than good"
1935,Downloaded it signed up but never received the link to confirm my email tried it three times check my SPAM folder my social folder and nothing so it looks like I can't use the app
1936,App never saves my login info and crashes every 2 days causing me to redo my budget. No thanks.
1937,"This app is a joke. Had to request initial verification email four times. Then, once I tried to sign in it just kept spinning for 15 minutes."
1938,"Forget password link does not reset password, instead it brings you to the page that ask for password.... and the cycle goes on."
1939,Very basic functionality. There is no way to see monthly or yearly averages. The credit car and bank account syncing is very hit or miss. It works sometimes and not others. I often end up with duplicate entries. Anything with 2 factor authentication does not sync well at all. And some credit cards are not supported. I end up exporting all the data to excell to get monthly averages. I am going to give up and do all the tracking in excel since this app wastes more time than it saves.
1940,It won't even let me log in. I'll keep trying for a while but then I'll be Uninstaller. Very disappointed.
1941,Couldn't get it to work.
1942,A budgeting app that doesn't even budget except if you sign up for a subscription which is the exact opposite of what a budget is for.
1943,"Not worth using an app from a company that risks their employees lives during covid. Plus, Dave Ramsey stalks and harrasses ex-employees. I wish I new how awful this organization was a long time ago."
1944,"These guys are so far behind the curve for an app that's drowning in a saturated market. Really only does what other comparable apps do, but worse."
1945,Won't work
1946,"You have to ""sign up"" with an email and complex password."
1947,This app completely sucks and does not pull bank transactions. it just seems funny that it seems to work fine for your 14-day trial then all of the sudden after they charge me full price then I can't seem to get one full month of transactions to pull without contacting customer service. today is December 7th I have not had any transaction pulled onto my account since November 22nd. second time I have had to contact customer service for the same issue and of course there is no refunds.
1948,Makes no damn sense. It doesn't explain anything. How am I supposed to know how to use it???
1949,This app is very slippery Do not sign up It's a waste of money for what the service is.
1950,"Unable to sign in for days. The site keeps crashing, which is frustrating! I have other friends who report the same issue."
1951,I had this app a while ago and loved it. It was $10 a month to keep your bank synced. They now want 129 for the full suite of apps. I dont want to pay that.
1952,What a piece of Garbage app...right after you sign in for the first time the first question is great then the second question tryes to forces me to pick an option which none apply to me or am not allowed to continue and I'm not gonna be a fake Christian by lying.
1953,"We are canceling our subscription. (1) as other users said, the syncing with the bank is very glitchy (2) in the last year, there have been a total of 8 weeks where it wouldn't sync with the bank at all. (3) when it was down for 5-6 weeks in the spring, the support team said they would add 6 weeks to my membership. (4) they did not (5) it has been down another 2-3 weeks and (6) support team denies they ever agreed to lengthen my membership. **I paid to have it sync with my bank, but it won't**"
1954,I just paid for ramsey plus last week and now all of a sudden its telling me to sign up again and won't let me reconnect my bak account. There also was supposed to ve graphs to help track spending and i can't find them anywhere now. I want my money back.
1955,Cannot even log in with correct information
1956,"This app is a mess. Just recently, all my transactions for the month of November are all deleted! all budget lines are messed up!!! You guys need to fix this mess!"
1957,Takes you out of app to log in
1958,I've been trying to add my paychecks but it just won't add it up.
1959,"Much like other reviewers, I am extremely disappointed with how Everydollar has gone downhill. Can't connect to the bank, then it reconnects at some point and downloads doubles of all your transactions, giving you the huge task of sorting transactions you thought were already categorized and manually deleting doubles. Also some random transactions are still missing! Everydollar USED TO BE GOOD which is why this is so frustrating. It's basically unusable at this point. Does Dave know about this??"
1960,We never received the products we payed for.
1961,"AVOID. Paid $130 for Every Dollar +it is a total RIP off. App used to sync with my bank, now it doesn't. Their engineers have been ""working on it"" for 4 weeks. Dave would be disappointed with the customer service we received. Paid for it, can't use it, but no refund."
1962,"Straight up scam . Went and signed up for trial to Ramsey + and billed me right away . I always sign up for trials and immediately cancel and they still charged me immediately for $140 bucks . Stay away , now I need to battle with paypal and google to get my money back"
1963,Does not sync properly with my bank. I get duplicate and sometimes even more transactions which makes it very messy to track things. Im working with their support currently but it isnt looking good. I like Dave Ramsey and his teachings and have even taught a class but this is very disappointing. If we could get the software to work id be satisfied but they dont seem to want to work very hard to resolve this issue. Ill update my review if this becomes resolved. Otherwise id recommend staying away.
1964,Constantly have to sign in. Then password malfunctions.
1965,They charged me an unbelievable amount to use this app. I had already canceled and removed from my phone. Would like a refund.
1966,Do not work on my phone. Could not open.
1967,I wanted to like this app. I needed something to help me budget a little bit better. However it doesn't always work and then it logs me out and I have issues logging back in. At this point its more of a hassle then helpful.
1968,"I used to love this app. After the last upgrade, I noticed it was slower, but nothing concerning. Then, it started popping error messages every time I tried to record a transaction and crashing every time I was adding a new category. Of course I removed and re-installed it several times, nothing changed. Bugs escalated in severity until yesterday, when it logged out from my account by itself and deleted all the transaction of last two months. Switching to another app, so sorry though."
1969,"It was good until it stopped loading Bank transactions. I bank with two separate banks and one of them is fine, but my other bank (the one I use the most) stopped updating transactions since 17th June. It updates the account balances but doesn't show any transactions. I understand glitches happen but it's a long time for an issue to occur and still no fix."
1970,"The app was very very good and responsive before the major update was released. Now it takes a while to load and will eventually crash. Do improve on this as you've just ruined the experience of using your app which was already the best in the market. This app deserves all the 5 star rating it can get but after the major update, 1 star is more aptly deserved. Can't imagine what it feels like paying premium version for the app."
1971,"Working worse with every version. Since transition to the new ui the app is actually working worse with every update. Completely rebuilding it should mean that it will work better instead you provide broken functionality that you charge for and make it even more broken. Recent updates broke open banking functionality, it's like you are deliberately trying to make ppl not to use your app. Premium version has no use at the moment."
1972,"I don't write reviews usually, but this time I'm extremely disappointed with the new big release. I have been using Spendee since 2018. I have been contemplating to get the lifetime subscription but now I am glad I didn't after all. Need an alternative app now. 1) The app is dead slow now when opening, and this has made it difficult to record expenses fast. 2) The spending pie chart has shrunk and too small now. 3) The daily bars for an expense category is gone too."
1973,"This was a good app, i can recorder my expense without Internet, the response was fast , allow me to record the expense or check the record details fast. However the Spendee 5 really a horrible release. It required Internet and the loading is damaged slow. I had email to the support team without release my frustration here. However, the reply from the email was telling me not to keep follow up as this will slow down the fixing, after few months of waiting the slowness issue still there."
1974,"I used to love this app, was also a long term paid subscriber but idk why their services got bad since last year I've been struggling to use it, sometimes sync issues, sometimes load issues and no improvement in view even after so many ticket raises and emails. what has gone wrong with the developers? please work on it ASAP or you'll just lose all your users, if that's not what you want now."
1975,I've been using since 5 years ago for trx record and basic expenses analysis. Before update it worked flawlessly even on older devices. But with new updates it takes minutes just to record any trx. It takes forever to load & sync. Aren't the data stored offline and only sync at backend? Why is it so laggy? It actually has the gut to sell premium pack even when it can't load basic functions properly. I used to love this app and even recommend to friends. Now I HATE this app. I am switching!
1976,"I've been using this app for over 2 years and use to love the interface. after all the recent updates, the app takes forever to load and update and freezes quite often on me. I would not recommend, I will be switching to another budgeting app after 1 July this year."
1977,I can't use this app anymore because I changed my mobile and I'm trying to login to my account by Facebook but I got error message said: feature unavailable facebook login is currently unavailable for this app... any help ?? And anyway after last major update this app become worst and slower and need Internet to open !!!
1978,"Unfortunately the app is not getting better. I'm using it for years now. I hoped that it will be improved, but still lots of bugs. My yearly subscription would renew in next month, but probably I won't renew it and find another app."
1979,"I've just deleted my spendee account and uninstalled, after being a paid plus subscriber for 2 years. The app simply doesn't scale after 12 or so months of data are in and leads to ridiculously long load times on high end phones as well as on the web. This app looks professional but is built on a house of cards, which will topple once you've added a few hundred transactions... avoid."
1980,"Trying to upgrade but I dont see how. When I click the Upgrade link in the menu, it takes me to a page with the variois options bit there is no button or link to actuall upgrade...only information. I dont know if you have regional blocks but im in South Africa. Loading USA bank accounts, however."
1981,"I'm sorry but the app is not as good as it was before...and that's sad... I used it for 3 years+ but now it's slow, doesn't work offline, and it takes forever to open up. Using version 5.0.26. Moved to another app"
1982,Used to be great when it first started but has become a lot slower after a few updates (mid to late 2020) with the new interface. Quite difficult to use now.
1983,"Will not be renewing the subscription. This app has been absolutely destroyed. Buggy, and extremely slow to launch. Been using for well over 3 years. Will look at alternatives now."
1984,New update has made my app super slow: the Initializing Spendee takes ages everytime I open the app. Still the same. Slow loads times are painful while trying to add quick transactions -30 April 2021
1985,"Pretty slow app. Too many unwanted notification and there's noway to turn off, even I've subscribed the plus plan. At leaat two notification per day to ask me upgrade to premium plan."
1986,This app has always been flakey but it simply doesn't work anymore. Takes a long time to sync my main bank account and never syncs with my credit card.
1987,"It was a nice app before the big update but widgets are now long gone, not user friendly. So much time has passed but issues are still the same"
1988,"All my old entries are gone after updating and have no wallet indicated. I can no longer start a new wallet either despite my old one disappearing. Terrible, terrible app."
1989,Useless after update. Initializing the app takes 22minutes and still counting. It should be not rely on internet only. Uninstalling on both of my devices.
1990,Cant add transactions when connected online it keeps loading and do nothing
1991,"This version (5.0.26),the calculator can't use."
1992,"The app was really very good before. Update to version 5 is terrible. Very slow, UI less intuitive (adding tags requires more time/steps, mainly for rarely used tags), no widget, now only one tag in free version, problems in offline mode. Overall, everyday use is now annoying. From my point of view, the new version isn't good app in many aspects."
1993,"This newest update has made the app worse. It's ugly and for some reason all my data from last October and before is all erased??? Terrible. Make sure you export all your data cause you never know when Spendee will just decide to erase it all! Update: The newest update hasn't changed anything. Spendee still loads slowly and the UI is STILL ugly. Spendee is the perfect example of developers justifying their jobs by ""updating"" their software but nothing is broken!!! Leave the app alone!"
1994,"add transaction with image get error, pls fix, thanks"
1995,"Using since 5 years, and now will need to change if your update keeps remaining so buggy and so damn slow. Which app takes 30 seconds to start! It's become a pain to add expense now. PS After some 5 months it has become horrible to pathetic. Calendar is gone, can't even set up the date. Looks like these guys have killed the app and given up on it. They're now charging for exporting the entire backup (because of course people will get fed up and leave this painful app)"
1996,"Whit my total balance is cero?? i can't see the all year spending overview and the app is very slowly, 5 years using your app and now everything go to the waste"
1997,"The latest redesign made the app so slow its almost unusable. It takes at least 15s to ""initialize"" each time you start the app. In addition, simple hashtags got renamed to ""labels"" and now free version allows only 1 per transaction. Will be looking for a new app."
1998,"Pretty much unusable now since the new update. If you plan on using this for a long time to record your spendings, I'd reconsider. Ever since the update, the data that I have been recording everyday for the past 2 years got all messed up - there were suddenly a LOT of duplicates, making my total spending 5 times more than it actually is (I actually can't tell for sure if it's just 5 times more). Also, I've noticed old categories are now missing, so previous data are now floating without labels."
1999,"I've been using the app for nearly a year now and liked it very much. Since the update in December, there have been nothing but problems with the app. It lags, crashes, and doesn't save entries. The option to add to a transaction is also gone now. I get so frustrated as I installed it to help make managing my finances easier, but all I do is wait for every little thing to load, causing a waste of time and energy. I wish the glitches would finally get fixed so I can continue to use and recommend."
2000,"I have been a happy user for the better part of 5 years. But then Ver.5 was released and everything went downhill from there. The widget is not working anymore, it takes a lot of time to initialize the app, every single time. The hashtag option was brilliant for tracking and it was not character sensitive which was perfect; now we have labels, and from UX perspective it is horrendous to interact with. I wish there was a way to return to an older version and keep on having a fluid experience."
2001,"Been using the app for several years. It got very bad recently. It won't connect to the bank account to download transactions. The system keeps adding new categories, even though it should not, because I set all of them. Customer service is almost non existent and they don't love your problems. It is just not worth it. Keep looking for a more professional app."
2002,"The new version is very disappointing and not usable. The UI lags and is difficult to use. It takes 5 seconds to launch the app, 2 seconds for each operation, roughly half a minute to finish adding one transaction. The ""Work"" category icon cannot be displayed properly when adding a transaction. Hey, developer! Existing users are upset and have abandoned the app; then what kind of new users will download the app when they see an average 2.9 stars rating? Please bring back the old version!"
2003,"After using the premium version for 2 years, I've officially uninstalled this useless app. My balances have got to negative for some reason and a lot of transactions are missing. It is slow, unstable, and it can't even save your data properly. Do not, under any circumstances, consider this useless app. It takes a lot for me to actually bother to review an app but spendee is just that bad."
2004,"UI is awful. Everything is clumsy, animations are slow and weird. Something just doesn't work at all, like manually editing wallet in settings: you just can't enter the amount because of ugly scientific notation or something. So, I just can't start using the app at all. The first time I open the app, a subscription screens is shown to me and I'm like ""Whaat?"". Looks like you hired a couple of junior devs and they messed up everything, using non-native framework. I hope it's not Flutter."
2005,"I have tried many, many finance apps but this is the worst! Downloaded it about a month ago and accidentally signed up for a subscription so thought, what the hell, despite being pretty pissed off about them taking money out without telling. Me. Anyway, it's been a complete waste of my $33 bucks. Couple of days ago, my transactions stopped coming through so I disconnected the bank to try and resync. Then the new update happened and now I can't connect at all. Don't waste your time."
2006,"I NEVER leave reviews, but the new update compelled me to come write one. I hate everything about the update. I've used spendee for years and now the app is so difficult to use and takes forever to find things that used to be so easy to see. To this day I still don't know where they moved the setting to turn on fingerprint verification for security. Also, every time I add a transaction now the app buffers for 5EVER. I now regret getting the lifetime subscription, such a waste of a good app!"
2007,"Spendee was super fast and effective before the upgrade. The moment the template changed, it became slow, poor interface, etc. There is no excitment to track my spending when i spend several minutes trying to connect. Also, the previous app works without internet, right now this new one cannot load without the internet... please take us back to the previous one!!!"
2008,"Used this app for quite a time and always loved, how easy it was to manage and track my finances. New update was a huge disappointment for this reasons: 1. Extremely slow loading time that led me a few times to close app before adding transaction. 2. No intuitive UI/UX anymore. Now it takes longer to figure out where is the functionality for which I'm looking for. 3. Missing functionality showing average daily expenses in given month of all categories together as well as individual ones."
2009,"First time writing a review ever because I'm hugely disappointed with the New UI. Less user user friendly than the previous. I want to track my spending in the least clicks possible. Previous UI, I only needed a single tap to track my spending in the wallet of my choice. Easy, seamless. With the new UI, tapping the '+' only calls out the last recently used wallet. It takes at least an extra 3 clicks to find the correct wallet, before I select the transaction category on this again. Why?!"
2010,New update is absolutely terrible. I have used for years and will no longer use. The old interface was easy to use and the info was clear. I used it to see my spending and now it takes lots of clicks and is so unclear! I also can no longer search my tags/ labels to see total spend of each category. Absolutely trash and I wish I'd never hit update!
2011,Hi Team - I am really unhappy with the last update. I have lost all my transactions from October 2020 till today and there is no support from the Spendee team. I have already dropped emails and requested to share the lost data but all efforts are in vain. Previously the app was much better in many ways. I did not get a chance to explore the app post update as I am really pissed as I have lost my day to day transactions from past 4 months. This was not expected. I was so excited for Spendee 5.
2012,"I was using this app for at least 3 years. After last update it got way worse. First of all - opening and loading time is very long. So annoying that this kind of app needs at least 4-6 sec to open, and for any other click in the app it takes at least 2-3 sec. I dont want to waste my time. Secondly - it was user-friendly before the update. I am non-premium user and was able to use hashtags as much as I needed. Now it replaced with labels, and I can choose only one! Thirdly, just deleting the app"
2013,The 1 star review is to hopefully grab the attention of the developers. This is a good app. It is April 10th but my timeline only shows up to the 6th and there is no reason I can find for this nor any way to fix it. This isn't a complaint but rather a note to the developer to hopefully reply and tell me of a fix. Another issue is that there is no easy way... or any way to contact the developer. Mostly though it's a good app.
2014,"I've payed a premium plan for one year, but some errors in the platform are really unbearable. Some transactions has disappear from my account, then I can't believe in that application. The last January 16th I've wrote an email to support told them each one my problems with he app, but until now I don't received none answer. Now I want that they return my money, I can't wait them for a solution and their delay."
2015,"EDIT 2: To spendee's credit, they did solve an account balance mismatch issue in an update in the past. Since then, the ui has taken a turn for the worse. And more importantly, bank synchronisation has stopped working and has been throwing errors for the past month. This app had become unusable and I'd like my money back. Stay clear of this app."
2016,Worse!this apps need internet connection and moreover all my previous data is gone!
2017,"As a long time user I have to say UX in v5 has gone down. I use custom time range because in previous version I could see how much will I save in advance. Now, that information is gone. It doesn't show estimate based on scheduled transactions. Also putting a new transaction now requires a tap to put a value. Just bad bad. This review comes from a fellow product designer. UPDATE: This app is unusable. Slow, unreliable... After years of using, uninstalling..."
2018,I would highly suggest that you rollback the app to the previous version and test this new version extensively before releasing for public consumption. The new version is really disappointing. I can appreciate the attempt to improve the app but this upgrade is way below the standard I expect from your company based on the previous iteration of this app.
2019,"The update ruined it. Despite the broken calendar selection during export it was fast and easy to use. After the most recent update it's slow, unresponsive, feels very cluttered, text became quite small and now requires a paid membership to export the complete wallet. I also don't care about multiple wallets since I only use one so I don't need the wallet button and wallet info everywhere. I considered purchasing it even though the free functions were sufficient, but now I definitely won't."
2020,"[After the ""big update"" : 1. IMPRACTICAL LAYOUT, slow at processing every interaction. Suggestion that helps; undo everything back to older version, seriously. What's wrong with the older version..? Before the ""big update"" : First, you buy this app for a month, which costs you less than nothing. second, create your own budget daily/monthly, and or annually. Third, be consistent in inputting / journalling every single personal cashflow. Fourth, watch wonders. Great app. This app is underrated."
2021,I tried spendee for just over a month. Half way through the trial the UI totally changed without notice. The bank update feature of which you pay for works poorly and crashed multiple times whilst setting it up. The browser version of spendee is currently read only and next to useless. I requested support for the bank sync issue and got zero response. The unsubscribe from their spam emails requesting to rejoin premium (I was premium at the time) goes to a dead link. How did this app win awards?
2022,"I have paid for this app. At the begging was wonderful, but after some versions it's almost imposible to access the app and is to slow when I want to do some task in it."
2023,"Disappointing update - no more widget, no more hashtag to label, no more slick UX. I'd rather pay for rolling back to the previous version than upgrading to premium. Edit: Please roll back to the past version! Two months since my comment has passed but literally nothing has improved. Still takes forever to initiate even if I pinned the app to be kept in background. And you don't need to remind how much discount you're offering every now and then if your app really works."
2024,"Its completely messy now. After the new update, the new interface looks cool. But after change new month, all my transaction become messy, [1] I dont understand how to read my Cash Flow anymore, totally don't understand. [2] The sync between phones is getting worse. [3] The recurrence function is getting weird, I totally don't understand how to use it. [4] Before the update, it required password to enter the App, but after the update, no password required."
2025,"The perfect example of a beautiful and perfectly fine app, completely ruined by the update. To all others who plan to take a subscription – it’ll be a waste of your money. Start looking for alternatives. Now to the specific problem – Earlier, I could export my expenses for all my wallets in a single Excel/csv…with a choice for multiple Excels (per wallet) if I wanted. Now you have killed the single Excel option and as a result I have to spend hours trying to consolidate my expenses from different Excels/wallets. Unfortunately, I have to move to a different app because of this. My guess is that all this is the result of a new manager/architect who wanted to plant his flag in the sand (just like all new people in positions of power do) and in the process fooled the entire organization/owner into believing they needed a completely overhaul. The person doesn’t know anything about agile/incremental software. No wonder you are constantly delayed in your release."
2026,"The app definitely has gotten snappier and has much fewer errors or bugs (if any), but I just can't take in the new UI. No matter how hard I try I find myself avoiding even using the app anymore, I hate it compared to the old one and I really wish there was some way I could switch back. Hate the thought of it but I might have to fund another budgeting tool, and I'd really hate to as I've been on board with Spendee for nearly 4 years now. :("
2027,"I paid for premium subscription and this app is so hard to use. I can't connect to any of my transactions to mange them correctly. They are just put into whatever categories the app decides to put them in. If I knew I had to enter them manually for any sort of results I was looking for, I would have utilized excel spreadsheets. I cant even cancel my subscription because the ""web app"" doesn't work. When it signs me in it just shows up as a blank page. I'm filing a dispute with my bank."
2028,"Update: still a lot of bugs. The bank account synchronization does not work correctly (reconsider buying). Duplicate transactions / missing transactions, with no possibility to fix it yourself. Bugs when creating bank account connections... Still not worth the money at this point App loads slowly. FYI - Maybe considering creating a widget to add new transaction? I dont need to have my transactions loaded if I just want to add a transaction. I think this would reduce the loading time by a lot..."
2029,"The App was awesome before the update! I'm a lifetime premium member but after the update I really feel very bad. Fingerprint lock is removed after the update, all my data was synced before update but after update one wallet is showing different values, all my current data is synced but when I want to see my past transactions the app keeps on loading until it gets hanged. They've made the App WORSE after the update."
2030,"I had bought lifetime subscription. Then came the update, they shut down the app for 2.5 months for the update. Web version did not work for a further one month.The update is full of bugs. Update takes longer, new wallet could not be added (fixed now), you cannot edit expenses and change to another category. Is it me or the Customer service has gone downhill since the update?"
2031,"The new version is really laggy. Why change something that works with something that's more shiny? I don't want my subscription money be spent on good looking pixels! Won't continue my subscription if it will stay this way because, in this state, it's anoying to use. L.E: I'm downgrading this to a 1 star. Would go lower but this is the maximum I can, unfortunately. The app is stuck at the loading screen for at least 1 week now. Will definitely not upgrade my subscription. RIP Spendee"
2032,"I was one of the happiest Spendee promoter among friends. It was an amazing app! Very well built and useful! Then, the new update came. Now the app is almost unusable: 15s to open and slow as hell in adding new transactions (10s). I really timed the times. (I'm under good connection of course. Already cleared app data, logged out, logged in, totally reinstalled the app: slowness still here.) And finally: Spendee support got worse too. I'm awaiting a reply from them since 2+ weeks."
2033,"Eversince the update, records have been inaccurate. The loading for the app to open takes forever and I wish it just looked the same but it looks more sophisticated now. Paid for this app and It doesn't function as well as it used to. It even needs an Internet connection to open now! Very disappointed :("
2034,I lost all my data (2 years) from the latest update. Sent an email for help but no one responded yet. I have logged in but how come data could be lost? Update: Received an email from the team that my issue would be forwarded to development team. Almost 10 days past and no updates from them. Very disappointed and moving on to other budget app. Bye spendee
2035,"New bug to add: spending overview for previous month refreshes in 10-15 seconds jumping back to the current month. This update is a fail. Startup time is still infinite, the list of spending loads each time it appears and while loading it is empty. It's a disaster, I've been using this app for more than 2 years. Newcomers you should look for another app"
2036,I'm going to cancel the yearly subscriptions after the `big update`. Thank you Spendee for giving me a chance to find better alternative app. the new update is terrible. i dont see any improvement since the `big update`. everything is slow now. i was satisfied with the app for 2 years using this app. now really disappointed with the `Disaster Update`.
2037,"Freezes and crashes. No easy way to open bug report. Shame, I am a paid user! Edit: no more.crashes but few bugs. No response from support after 9 days. Critical bug as income transactions from my main account are not showing. This makes the app unusable. Need to find better app when my current membership expires."
2038,"I can't recommend any longer as the update broke two thing very important to me. Love the UI and want to keep using this, but Widget is no longer available for ease of use and it no longer offers fingerprint/biometric login to prevent others from seeing my expenses if using my phone. Please fix otherwise I have to leave."
2039,"I hope the widgets will be back in next versions (3 stars). -> Reducing to 1 star for incredible slowness. -> The app opens a little faster with the latest update (2 stars) -> No, it's still unbelievably show (1 star). It's hard to imagine how one can ruin so hardly built user experience in one unfortunate update"
2040,Everything is so messed up after the update. It was simpler and easy to use with better functionality. Now... It lags and my wallets got messed up too. Sometimes things are best when left untouched. Devs need to sort this out.
2041,#Uninstall_Spendee I have using Spendee from long time of year & I was very happy with these app & features also that time I gave 5 Star rating but by the last update the app became very worst as there are many difficulty came during the using these app. Also the unique & very simple features of #Hashtag is removed & came with Labels. #Hashtag was very helpful features & we can track any expenses easily. Try to update the app as previous one otherwise there is no need use these app
2042,"I really loved this app until I updated to the latest version. It is a disaster. I need to spend 30secs to open the app and 30 secs to record a transaction. Also, I cannot open the app if the phone does not have internet connection."
2043,"The previous version of the app got me used to flawless, mature UX. Unfortunately, the rewritten version has terrible performance issues and changes the established flow of adding transactions (first amount, then category) to less intuitive (first category, than amount). Please, fix it. I'm really considering a switch after 3 years with you."
2044,"It has been two months since this worst update. It takes long time to add just one entry, and can't add entry without mobile data. The keyword searching function also sucks in Chinese. I miss the old version of this app, please give that back to me."
2045,"Not using anymore. After recent updates app performance is terrible in loading. UX is not smooth at all. Some screen just remain plain white and do not load at all then close the app ia only option. Worst of all, forcing me to buy subscription. No free version anymore."
2046,"Very good app and helpful support. Update: After the new version it is difficult to use, slow and crashes on different screens. Looks like no test was done for this version at all. Rollback would be nice."
2047,Terrible. I'm unable to swipe left and right through the months. It was a feature before and now it is not. Please bring back the older version where i could swipe left and right to check timelines of different months.
2048,"Completely ruined after update, app won't load, lists won't save, just doesn't work people have been complaining about it for months, just revert it back to the old version and that's it. It was perfect."
2049,"Doesnt open. Just stuck on the loading screen. Unless i'll clear data and restart my phone, then it will go through."
2050,"1 stars due to before the update transactions can be categorised by adding multiple hashtags, but after the update it became labels and required monthly subscription to add multiple. This was the main reason I loved this app which allow me to analyse my transactions in multiple ways."
2051,"I used to love this app so much but after the GUI update , everything is too slow. The previous GUI is really good and easy to use I don't know why you try to make things more complicated and slow."
2052,Please Bring the App Back ! This V . 5 Update we are waiting for a fix with each new Update and the app still slow and i went from avid user to one who hate opening it as it gives me stress wasting my time . I need new app but been using this one over 6 years now . Please Fix It !!
2053,"I love this app but prior to todays update i felt the sudden frustration of using this, because of the speed when inputting transactions and navigating through the app. Please bring back the old version, i love the old spendeeee 😔"
2054,"Went from excellent to terrible. I'm a lifetime user but right now, it's not worth it. The performance issues are just unbearable. Wow. I don't really know until when you guys need to get it done. I can't even believe the app has 3.1 average rating now, should be like 1 or 2 IMO."
2055,"Please nerf this apps v5.0.12,I know you guys not gonna fix it, so nerf THE NEED DATA connection very annoying, have been using this apps since 2016 & on/off before that, this newest update really bad stuff,also I got no data/wifi connection all the time, that mean I can't see what left in my wallet or something like that.Even with connection to data, upload picture & stuff also very slow, have to delete my input several times. Very bad update. 😒"
2056,I was a very satisfied user of this app until I had a problem syncing one of my accounts that I placed to the customer support a month ago with no answer at all until today!!!!
2057,"Since the new update this month the app is awful, this was a great app and I had been using it for the past year. Up until last week the app was 5stars now i would recommend you look for a different app."
2058,"The update just killed the app, yeah now we have some fancy ui, but the app is so slow, almost every time that i add an expense or a new category i need to close and re-open the app to see it"
2059,It WAS great. This last version added more steps to do the same things as before. Why would you ruin a pretty simple workflow making it longer and more complex? I'm out.
2060,"With the new and updated app, don't even bother. It literally takes longer to do anything than if you wrote everything down with chalk on a piece of stone."
2061,Using shared wallet with my wife (as a guest) and suddenly all transactions are missing from her account. I'm using premium plan btw. And support team don't exist. Edit for developer's respond: I sent you an email a week ago and still no respond from your team
2062,"When I updated the app to the last version, I found that a lot of transactions between October 2020 & January 2021 disappeared, which cause a casatrophic situation in the ""total wealth"". I want to return to the old version. George Eldaya"
2063,Web app unusable for weeks. Widget disappeared without notice. New app has some obvious QA issues. Was the best app but bad project management took a toll on it.
2064,"It's really but for expenses tracker, takes 2-3weeks to see. This is the worst purchase I have ever made. If you wanna saving money, best way is Do not use this app"
2065,"The App is getting worse and worse with every update, before it was great and easy to use, now a lot of glitches and taking a lot of time to open, please do something."
2066,Premium subscription is useless even though my amount is deducted. I'm still unable to use Monthly subscription. No one from support is replying on my case which I registered before.
2067,Please bring old version back for me. I had used spendee for 4 years but this version i am so disappoint because it take a time for addind transection and always loading whole thing in the app.
2068,Updated still no resolution to my issue. Don't waste your time. Transactions don't seem to update. I thought this was going to be great but this defeats the purpose of why I would use this
2069,Cant add transactions when connected online it keeps loading and do nothing
2070,"I used to love this app. After the last upgrade, I noticed it was slower, but nothing concerning. Then, it started popping error messages every time I tried to record a transaction and crashing every time I was adding a new category. Of course I removed and re-installed it several times, nothing changed. Bugs escalated in severity until yesterday, when it logged out from my account by itself and deleted all the transaction of last two months. Switching to another app, so sorry though."
2071,Was good but not anymore
2072,"It was good until it stopped loading Bank transactions. I bank with two separate banks and one of them is fine, but my other bank (the one I use the most) stopped updating transactions since 17th June. It updates the account balances but doesn't show any transactions. I understand glitches happen but it's a long time for an issue to occur and still no fix."
2073,How in the world do you change categories??
2074,"So slow when opening the apps for the last month! Been using it for 5 months. Usually demotivate me to record my expenses and tend to procastinate. After i updated the apps, it require me to sign in again, i dont really remember my account. Hope it wont be reset 😭😔 urgh."
2075,"I've just deleted my spendee account and uninstalled, after being a paid plus subscriber for 2 years. The app simply doesn't scale after 12 or so months of data are in and leads to ridiculously long load times on high end phones as well as on the web. This app looks professional but is built on a house of cards, which will topple once you've added a few hundred transactions... avoid."
2076,"Unfortunately the app is not getting better. I'm using it for years now. I hoped that it will be improved, but still lots of bugs. My yearly subscription would renew in next month, but probably I won't renew it and find another app."
2077,I've been using since 5 years ago for trx record and basic expenses analysis. Before update it worked flawlessly even on older devices. But with new updates it takes minutes just to record any trx. It takes forever to load & sync. Aren't the data stored offline and only sync at backend? Why is it so laggy? It actually has the gut to sell premium pack even when it can't load basic functions properly. I used to love this app and even recommend to friends. Now I HATE this app. I am switching!
2078,Slow
2079,I can't use this app anymore because I changed my mobile and I'm trying to login to my account by Facebook but I got error message said: feature unavailable facebook login is currently unavailable for this app... any help ?? And anyway after last major update this app become worst and slower and need Internet to open !!!
2080,"Working worse with every version. Since transition to the new ui the app is actually working worse with every update. Completely rebuilding it should mean that it will work better instead you provide broken functionality that you charge for and make it even more broken. Recent updates broke open banking functionality, it's like you are deliberately trying to make ppl not to use your app. Premium version has no use at the moment."
2081,You use my personal data without my permission
2082,"Pretty slow app. Too many unwanted notification and there's noway to turn off, even I've subscribed the plus plan. At leaat two notification per day to ask me upgrade to premium plan."
2083,"It was a nice app before the big update but widgets are now long gone, not user friendly. So much time has passed but issues are still the same"
2084,"This was a good app, i can recorder my expense without Internet, the response was fast , allow me to record the expense or check the record details fast. However the Spendee 5 really a horrible release. It required Internet and the loading is damaged slow. I had email to the support team without release my frustration here. However, the reply from the email was telling me not to keep follow up as this will slow down the fixing, after few months of waiting the slowness issue still there."
2085,"it was the best app for spending tracking. But the latest update make it becoming the worst app on google play. if you have the problem with the programmer or the ui/ux designer, please resolve it ASAP. (update : I have move to another app and it is premium. good bye my old friend)"
2086,"Transfers are completely broken. If you transfer 500 USD to a GPB account, it will deposit 500GBP instead of 500 USD. It ignores the exchange rate. If you transfer money to a crypto wallet, it won't let you mark it as a transfer. Support is a black hole. There's no ticket tracking system, just an automated ""Thanks for your email!"". Then nothing."
2087,This app has always been flakey but it simply doesn't work anymore. Takes a long time to sync my main bank account and never syncs with my credit card.
2088,"After the new update, it takes too much time to open and it takes too much time for process the data as well as apps doesn't show any type of avarage different catagorey of expenses. Also increase/decrease percentage compare with previous month of different categories of expenses is also missing. I recommended to add those again. Now apps doesn't open without wifi connection 😡😡😡"
2089,Worse!this apps need internet connection and moreover all my previous data is gone!
2090,"All my old entries are gone after updating and have no wallet indicated. I can no longer start a new wallet either despite my old one disappearing. Terrible, terrible app."
2091,Used to be great when it first started but has become a lot slower after a few updates (mid to late 2020) with the new interface. Quite difficult to use now.
2092,"add transaction with image get error, pls fix, thanks"
2093,"Will not be renewing the subscription. This app has been absolutely destroyed. Buggy, and extremely slow to launch. Been using for well over 3 years. Will look at alternatives now."
2094,C'est devenu n'importe quoi c'est app. Ca n'arrete pas de bugger et c'est super lent depuis que vous avez transitionne a la nouvelle version. Ridicule!
2095,"I'm sorry but the app is not as good as it was before...and that's sad... I used it for 3 years+ but now it's slow, doesn't work offline, and it takes forever to open up. Using version 5.0.26. Moved to another app"
2096,"I used to love this app, was also a long term paid subscriber but idk why their services got bad since last year I've been struggling to use it, sometimes sync issues, sometimes load issues and no improvement in view even after so many ticket raises and emails. what has gone wrong with the developers? please work on it ASAP or you'll just lose all your users, if that's not what you want now."
2097,"The app was very very good and responsive before the major update was released. Now it takes a while to load and will eventually crash. Do improve on this as you've just ruined the experience of using your app which was already the best in the market. This app deserves all the 5 star rating it can get but after the major update, 1 star is more aptly deserved. Can't imagine what it feels like paying premium version for the app."
2098,"I don't write reviews usually, but this time I'm extremely disappointed with the new big release. I have been using Spendee since 2018. I have been contemplating to get the lifetime subscription but now I am glad I didn't after all. Need an alternative app now. 1) The app is dead slow now when opening, and this has made it difficult to record expenses fast. 2) The spending pie chart has shrunk and too small now. 3) The daily bars for an expense category is gone too."
2099,"This version (5.0.26),the calculator can't use."
2100,New update has made my app super slow: the Initializing Spendee takes ages everytime I open the app. Still the same. Slow loads times are painful while trying to add quick transactions -30 April 2021
2101,"The app was really very good before. Update to version 5 is terrible. Very slow, UI less intuitive (adding tags requires more time/steps, mainly for rarely used tags), no widget, now only one tag in free version, problems in offline mode. Overall, everyday use is now annoying. From my point of view, the new version isn't good app in many aspects."
2102,Useless after update. Initializing the app takes 22minutes and still counting. It should be not rely on internet only. Uninstalling on both of my devices.
2103,"Trying to upgrade but I dont see how. When I click the Upgrade link in the menu, it takes me to a page with the variois options bit there is no button or link to actuall upgrade...only information. I dont know if you have regional blocks but im in South Africa. Loading USA bank accounts, however."
2104,"Whit my total balance is cero?? i can't see the all year spending overview and the app is very slowly, 5 years using your app and now everything go to the waste"
2105,"The latest redesign made the app so slow its almost unusable. It takes at least 15s to ""initialize"" each time you start the app. In addition, simple hashtags got renamed to ""labels"" and now free version allows only 1 per transaction. Will be looking for a new app."
2106,Now this app is not allowing to select date l
2107,"I've been using this app for over 2 years and use to love the interface. after all the recent updates, the app takes forever to load and update and freezes quite often on me. I would not recommend, I will be switching to another budgeting app after 1 July this year."
2108,Any plan to bring back widget?
2109,It's WAS the shiz NITZZ. Then they updated it recently. Please let me know if you go back to your old format.
2110,"This newest update has made the app worse. It's ugly and for some reason all my data from last October and before is all erased??? Terrible. Make sure you export all your data cause you never know when Spendee will just decide to erase it all! Update: The newest update hasn't changed anything. Spendee still loads slowly and the UI is STILL ugly. Spendee is the perfect example of developers justifying their jobs by ""updating"" their software but nothing is broken!!! Leave the app alone!"
2111,"Bugs bugs everywhere, RIP Spendee 2021⚰️"
2112,"I have paid for this app. At the begging was wonderful, but after some versions it's almost imposible to access the app and is to slow when I want to do some task in it."
2113,"Using since 5 years, and now will need to change if your update keeps remaining so buggy and so damn slow. Which app takes 30 seconds to start! It's become a pain to add expense now. PS After some 5 months it has become horrible to pathetic. Calendar is gone, can't even set up the date. Looks like these guys have killed the app and given up on it. They're now charging for exporting the entire backup (because of course people will get fed up and leave this painful app)"
2114,"Doesnt open. Just stuck on the loading screen. Unless i'll clear data and restart my phone, then it will go through."
2115,"The new version is very disappointing and not usable. The UI lags and is difficult to use. It takes 5 seconds to launch the app, 2 seconds for each operation, roughly half a minute to finish adding one transaction. The ""Work"" category icon cannot be displayed properly when adding a transaction. Hey, developer! Existing users are upset and have abandoned the app; then what kind of new users will download the app when they see an average 2.9 stars rating? Please bring back the old version!"
2116,"Not using anymore. After recent updates app performance is terrible in loading. UX is not smooth at all. Some screen just remain plain white and do not load at all then close the app ia only option. Worst of all, forcing me to buy subscription. No free version anymore."
2117,The 1 star review is to hopefully grab the attention of the developers. This is a good app. It is April 10th but my timeline only shows up to the 6th and there is no reason I can find for this nor any way to fix it. This isn't a complaint but rather a note to the developer to hopefully reply and tell me of a fix. Another issue is that there is no easy way... or any way to contact the developer. Mostly though it's a good app.
2118,Please Bring the App Back ! This V . 5 Update we are waiting for a fix with each new Update and the app still slow and i went from avid user to one who hate opening it as it gives me stress wasting my time . I need new app but been using this one over 6 years now . Please Fix It !!
2119,Couldn't connect bank and I bought premium membership
2120,1. No way to adjust balance. 2. Support doesn't reply to email (waiting for more than 96 hours already). 3. App has sync issues with the browser version. There are just way too many deterrents. One star is way more than what the app deserve right now.
2121,I lost all my data (2 years) from the latest update. Sent an email for help but no one responded yet. I have logged in but how come data could be lost? Update: Received an email from the team that my issue would be forwarded to development team. Almost 10 days past and no updates from them. Very disappointed and moving on to other budget app. Bye spendee
2122,Was very good.. not anymore
2123,"New bug to add: spending overview for previous month refreshes in 10-15 seconds jumping back to the current month. This update is a fail. Startup time is still infinite, the list of spending loads each time it appears and while loading it is empty. It's a disaster, I've been using this app for more than 2 years. Newcomers you should look for another app"
2124,"The App is getting worse and worse with every update, before it was great and easy to use, now a lot of glitches and taking a lot of time to open, please do something."
2125,"Doesn't work offline, sometimes even online."
2126,"I was one of the happiest Spendee promoter among friends. It was an amazing app! Very well built and useful! Then, the new update came. Now the app is almost unusable: 15s to open and slow as hell in adding new transactions (10s). I really timed the times. (I'm under good connection of course. Already cleared app data, logged out, logged in, totally reinstalled the app: slowness still here.) And finally: Spendee support got worse too. I'm awaiting a reply from them since 2+ weeks."
2127,"The app definitely has gotten snappier and has much fewer errors or bugs (if any), but I just can't take in the new UI. No matter how hard I try I find myself avoiding even using the app anymore, I hate it compared to the old one and I really wish there was some way I could switch back. Hate the thought of it but I might have to fund another budgeting tool, and I'd really hate to as I've been on board with Spendee for nearly 4 years now. :("
2128,"I strongly recommend to look for alternatives. It had various synchronization issues in the past. There were fixed in a big update in December 2020 but at the cost of performance. Really, really slow. Kept waiting for performance improvements but 4 months later still none. It is completely inadmisible. The new version even has less free features built in and more limitations for the lower tiers than before. In the current state the app is, they should refund anyone who paid for it on lifetime. At this point I am no longer going to stay much on the app - is just a placeholder until we find somewhere to migrate our data. I kept saying this for the past 2 years but I think this is the turning point. So again, please consider a different application to avoid going throught he same issues we have."
2129,"After update, app stopped launching without internet connection. Please fix...."
2130,"Update March 2021: did you just remove all the labels from previous transactions?? ================= Instead of moving free features to the premium plan, consider adding new features there instead. Being able to do something, like adding multiple #tags to transactions, then putting that feature behind a paywall isn't good customer experience."
2131,"Hello team, could you please recommend who is you best competitor app... Would like to migrate to them. Your app has become too slow to use. Not worth the time n effort"
2132,"More update, more slow"
2133,"I paid for premium subscription and this app is so hard to use. I can't connect to any of my transactions to mange them correctly. They are just put into whatever categories the app decides to put them in. If I knew I had to enter them manually for any sort of results I was looking for, I would have utilized excel spreadsheets. I cant even cancel my subscription because the ""web app"" doesn't work. When it signs me in it just shows up as a blank page. I'm filing a dispute with my bank."
2134,"App is painfully slow after the v5 update. There have been a few more updates since then, none have noticably improved the problem."
2135,Using shared wallet with my wife (as a guest) and suddenly all transactions are missing from her account. I'm using premium plan btw. And support team don't exist. Edit for developer's respond: I sent you an email a week ago and still no respond from your team
2136,"I loved this app, but recent updates have made it virtually unusable for me. :( It is now really laggy, most of my categories disappeared, and I can no longer use multiple tags on a purchase. Would totally give the older versions of the app 5 stars, I wish I had never updated!"
2137,We need a single payment plan. Edit: 4 years after my review you dropped to a 3* app. I told you to give us the single payment option. Now everybody unsubscribe and you were left with just a few users. Good luck poor guys.
2138,Why after big update the app feel so laggy and slow.. I'm using this since 2016 and the best part of spendee is very fast from opening app.. Shouldn't sacrifice speed for beauty..
2139,We've been complaining for months... Just give us the old app... Nothing works on this new app. Even figures of transactions have been altered. Wallet balance have jumped up by more than 20%. And oh.. Don't come and mention the new update. Nothing significant has changed.
2140,"Completely ruined after update, app won't load, lists won't save, just doesn't work people have been complaining about it for months, just revert it back to the old version and that's it. It was perfect."
2141,"The new version is really laggy. Why change something that works with something that's more shiny? I don't want my subscription money be spent on good looking pixels! Won't continue my subscription if it will stay this way because, in this state, it's anoying to use. L.E: I'm downgrading this to a 1 star. Would go lower but this is the maximum I can, unfortunately. The app is stuck at the loading screen for at least 1 week now. Will definitely not upgrade my subscription. RIP Spendee"
2142,The latest app is super slow. So bad.
2143,"Do not update if you're in the old version from last year!!! I was part of the beta program in October, app start up time 2 minutes, any entry taking 30 seconds, gave feedback. Team did not fix these issues before roll out even though they broke the whole app. And yes being in beta broke my historical entries from several years!!! Fun times. Can't understand why team rolled out the new version when they new it's totally broken. Still is."
2144,"The update broken the app, I can use it via web but not on my phone 😢 - still broken"
2145,I'm going to cancel the yearly subscriptions after the `big update`. Thank you Spendee for giving me a chance to find better alternative app. the new update is terrible. i dont see any improvement since the `big update`. everything is slow now. i was satisfied with the app for 2 years using this app. now really disappointed with the `Disaster Update`.
2146,Lifetime premium is almost 9 times that of yearly premium and only 5 banks support from India. 2 years of subscription for lifetime premium can be logical. Pl work on it.
2147,Buggy app. The customer service is awful! The app is full of bugs. Please do refund!
2148,Terrible. I'm unable to swipe left and right through the months. It was a feature before and now it is not. Please bring back the older version where i could swipe left and right to check timelines of different months.
2149,"Was one of the best app before spendee 5, but now you have made this app worst."
2150,"The previous version of the app got me used to flawless, mature UX. Unfortunately, the rewritten version has terrible performance issues and changes the established flow of adding transactions (first amount, then category) to less intuitive (first category, than amount). Please, fix it. I'm really considering a switch after 3 years with you."
2151,"I used to love this app so much but after the GUI update , everything is too slow. The previous GUI is really good and easy to use I don't know why you try to make things more complicated and slow."
2152,I was a very satisfied user of this app until I had a problem syncing one of my accounts that I placed to the customer support a month ago with no answer at all until today!!!!
2153,"Performance got better with each update. But, please retain the month tab when i change the view between wallet overview and wallet transaction. I don't want to see wallet overview for current month when I'm viewing november 2020 transaction! I want to see the november 2020 overview! Not refreshed everything and show me the current month!"
2154,"Can't link Australian bank account. Weak, shallow response from HR department. Clearly after weeks, I have tried to contact support."
2155,The old version is better
2156,"EDIT 2: To spendee's credit, they did solve an account balance mismatch issue in an update in the past. Since then, the ui has taken a turn for the worse. And more importantly, bank synchronisation has stopped working and has been throwing errors for the past month. This app had become unusable and I'd like my money back. Stay clear of this app."
2157,"Why can't we add more than 1 label after the update, it says only premium users."
2158,Lag in my device.
2159,"I hate the new update. I'm very disappointed. Apps being slow respond, no widget. The before version was the best ever."
2160,New update is absolutely terrible. I have used for years and will no longer use. The old interface was easy to use and the info was clear. I used it to see my spending and now it takes lots of clicks and is so unclear! I also can no longer search my tags/ labels to see total spend of each category. Absolutely trash and I wish I'd never hit update!
2161,No wonder why it is rated 3.0 stars
2162,"Have been using this app for years, but now I'm really considering switching. The last update lost a bunch of my entries. Now I don't even want to go back and see if anything has improved. Forgot to mention that I already reached out regarding this and I was already informed that there's nothing that can be done."
2163,"I had bought lifetime subscription. Then came the update, they shut down the app for 2.5 months for the update. Web version did not work for a further one month.The update is full of bugs. Update takes longer, new wallet could not be added (fixed now), you cannot edit expenses and change to another category. Is it me or the Customer service has gone downhill since the update?"
2164,"Eversince the update, records have been inaccurate. The loading for the app to open takes forever and I wish it just looked the same but it looks more sophisticated now. Paid for this app and It doesn't function as well as it used to. It even needs an Internet connection to open now! Very disappointed :("
2165,"Было быстрым, простым и удобным. Стало медленным, сложным и неудобным. 5 лет пользовался, похоже буду искать альтернативы."
2166,"The update ruined it. Despite the broken calendar selection during export it was fast and easy to use. After the most recent update it's slow, unresponsive, feels very cluttered, text became quite small and now requires a paid membership to export the complete wallet. I also don't care about multiple wallets since I only use one so I don't need the wallet button and wallet info everywhere. I considered purchasing it even though the free functions were sufficient, but now I definitely won't."
2167,"As a long time user I have to say UX in v5 has gone down. I use custom time range because in previous version I could see how much will I save in advance. Now, that information is gone. It doesn't show estimate based on scheduled transactions. Also putting a new transaction now requires a tap to put a value. Just bad bad. This review comes from a fellow product designer. UPDATE: This app is unusable. Slow, unreliable... After years of using, uninstalling..."
2168,Doesn't let you explicitly set Venmo username on your account. Which creates a terrible payment user experience. Venmo money sent to non existing account. And then having to reverse it. I don't understand why it's not possible to set your Venmo username. This garbage user experience
2169,"Terrible! Some months ago if you'd have asked me, I would have said it's a great app. But now it constantly glitches for our group and shows wrong calculations or settled up even when the other person owes something. And don't bother asking me to email you, because I already emailed support a month ago and you guys didn't bother responding. Moving on to better apps!"
2170,"This app does NOT simplify sharing expenses among roommates. In fact, it's a monthly headache to figure out the missed details in the totals it gives us. We just want ONE number that tells us what to pay each person. But it neglects certain costs, especially if you have a private expense with a person that's also in the group. We also have different totals for costs among us which causes tension. We're looking for a new app or we're reverting to pen and paper. Run away, don't walk!"
2171,I got automatically logged out and couldn't log back in. Idk if it's down. I'll update if problem gets solved
2172,In Group Expenses there should be an option of viewing every group members expenses seperately. In the current application I can see total group expenses and only my expense. There should be a provision of viewing contribution of each group members by a single click.
2173,"The new update has made things worse. The expense has not been split up equally like it used to. And in the friends tab, a person who's owing a lot of money is being shown as 'settled up'. Please fix the issue"
2174,Too much lagging now a days. Notification comes first and the update of the entry takes more than 2 minutes. Edited: Issue fixed. New UI is not insightful. Needs more improvement.
2175,Bad app design - using the number 0 in your passcode locks you out since the actual log in screen doesn't have the 0 key - instead there's a biometric scan button that also doesn't work.
2176,The latest updates have made things worse.I am unable to add any expenses and after I reinstalled it does not even go past the welcome screen.The developers have messed up the new update.
2177,"Please bring back the old design before the recent update, its confusing and frustrating to add a simple expense or even to find out how money i owe. Please"
2178,I agree with all the other reviewers. The previous design was far more usable and practical. Why did you ruin one of my favorite apps?
2179,"Requires you to sign in to use, requires you to add your friends phone contacts to add to group. Overly complicated at something as basic as splitting money."
2180,A bug in recent updates: when u update an expense it saves to different group.. creates mess sometimes.
2181,Some time expense show in different person account... So many bugs.
2182,It has jumbled up all the expenses. I am noting one thing very clearly and it is saving something else altogether.
2183,I purchased Splitwise Pro and the money got deducted but it's showing membership cancelled. And neither the money is refunded.
2184,Go back to the cleaner UI please. The new UI is unnecessary complicated and unintuitive.
2185,Calculations are incorrect. Simplifying group debts make it even more confusing.
2186,"For version 5.0.1/511 Absolutely terrible, clunky and overcomplicated new UI. Too many tabs, too many unnecessary clicks for something the earlier version did with minimal effort. Why fix something that isn't broken? Please go back to UI like the earlier versions. Coz the current one is ruined in the pursuit of ""minimalistic simplicity."""
2187,"Splitwise didn't work correctly, miscalculated what everyone owed, we had to do th math ourselves"
2188,"This app is great, I'd highly recommend it for sharing expenses etc however they still don't have a dark mode which makes it difficult for me to use as I have a vision imparement. It's one of the few apps on my phone to not have a dark mode. Hopefuy they can introduce this and K can give the app the 5 stars it deserves!"
2189,"It was great until last update, I am not able to add expense and save it until I add .00 in the amount section. For example, if I add 150 dollars it won't accept it. I have to add 155.00 and save it. Horrible"
2190,"I really loved this app but hate the new version.. When splitting the bill by share, by default EVERYONE in a group has one share. It's extremely inconvenient if there are some people not involved and the shares need to be changed from 1 to 0 for EVERY one of these people... Please change this back to the default of having 0 shares."
2191,"My God this app caused nothing but chaos... it's the first time im using it but everyone got frustrated.. I don't have venmo I can't pay ppl like that maybe add Google pay also, but damn people's transactions aren't showing up, I don't know if I got paid etc. Will prob never use again"
2192,It was my favourite app until they change the UI and UX. I loved the complete interface untill the last month but now it's just super annoying colours and icons which are very difficult to use. Please revert the designs back.
2193,Can't update group photos on Pixel 4a
2194,"It's UI (some tiles) is difficult to use, everytime i confused while using, it's ux slight to be improve for easy use."
2195,"its awesome but needs to keep on enhancing and add new features because what may feel awesome now may not be the same after few years. we always want more and more and hence many new options, tweaks , features are possible in this app. if i or my friends can think , their product head can also do it. Update (Reason for 1 star): Changed the UI in negative terms. Earlier UI and features were simple , minimalistic. Font size was large earlier. Now font size reduced and entire UI became pathetic"
2196,"It had been the best app and my favorite one, before its interface changed a week ago. Please, turn it back! Round icons, green head, big gap between name of a group and its amount - were more convinient to use and had better design. Really, rectangular icons are ugly :( I also dislike that inside an expence box the calendar button and the group button have switched their places."
2197,"I really dislike the new interface - Splitwise has been a well loved and well used app of mine for years now. Having gotten used to the old interface for so long, it had the same sudden shock of transition from Windows 7 to 8, and it's made everything harder than it was before. Why fix something that's not broken?"
2198,Just coz I am hating the new UI. It almost looks like a Google doc. Earlier version was so beautiful and genuinely good UX (plus minus few things)
2199,New interface is horrible and doesn't work great. A button was hiding a person in a group so I couldn't see there name. Why change something that works so well??? Please change it back or give us the option to
2200,"The recent update is making me consider delete the app. The previous version was cleaner, more user friendly and I was recommended to everyone! Please make the older and new version an option. I really enjoy your app, but if don't change anything about this new version, I'll move to another app, I'm sorry :("
2201,"I love splitwise and it does the job perfectly, I also appreciate the new clean design. But this is too bright! Please release a dark mode asap, the current design is literally a flashlight."
2202,My housemates and I loved this app but updates have made this so buggy! Settling balances in a group doesn't settle it with people over all and it makes random enteries when you settle up to the point where we no longer trust the app with our finances and no won't be using it any longer
2203,"After the recent update: Can't type the amount, that field not working ! Unusable No payment options other than paytm! that's not convenient, You should add UPI and other modes of payment"
2204,"Day by day is going worst. We are using it now for Shuttle team split up for weekly payments. There r only 2 or 3 guys pays, so payback should show to those guys only. Where as it's showing many complicated way, x pay to y, y pay to z, and after again pay back to main guy. Very difficult to understand what's going on behind."
2205,"New update is really disappointing. Not easily understand. Even whiteboard option is also missing which helps to add the important notes for the group. Please revert back, I lost the saved notes."
2206,I would give one start because here you can't delete your expense. Once you have added anything your account will be forever with them. You won't understand this now but in future you will regret for using this app so don't use it when you can't control your own account.
2207,They are not giving option to remove account. They are just keeping user sensitive information with them. I was having 2 accounts and I am trying to delete one but no option available. Even Facebook gives this option but splitwise not giving. Don't install it
2208,"With new update, it's prompting for biometric for every single interaction inside the app. It's getting frustrating to use it."
2209,"App can not sync any data , they show internet connection is poor, anf i also uninstall the app and reinstall the app, login not work. Worse experience day by day."
2210,Very bad app. Out of my mind. Not easy to handle at all. It should be like even an illeterate can handle this app.😏
2211,This app casually links Splitwise accounts to the wrong Venmo account without the slightest warning. Extremely dangerous and careless on their part. Sort it out.
2212,I don't know if you guys are updating this app now . Because your all functionality in app is not working currently. I tried many times to add but everytime i showed settled by default .
2213,After getting the new update it is worse. Uploaded photos of bills are showing in croped form and i am not even able to zoom the photo.
2214,With the new update this app has become very user unfriendly and it keep crashing.
2215,Crashes each time I add an expense
2216,Fails to calculate the total properly. I've sent an email with a video of the bug. Let's see if it gets resolved.
2217,I liked the previous UI much better. It would be great if you can make can option to switch UIs
2218,Since updating to Android 11 the app crashes continuously and i cannot access it! Tried reinstalling and didn't work. Help!
2219,After updation.. all names are not visible while adding exances.. it showing only 7 persons.. please make the bug fix.
2220,"Really really horrible app, adds amount automatically, don't download there are much better apps. 2 boys fought because of stupid balances added by splitwise itself"
2221,Just hate new UI. Totally messy & previous UI was clean & clear
2222,"Keeps old expenses even after settling, which makes it super confusing to use."
2223,New update is scrapped the app. Now getting server error while adding new expenses. Tells no permission.
2224,The app is getting crashed every second i open it.
2225,New update giving me headache Everytime if i add new expense app automatically crashing
2226,Unable to use after installation. Keeps crashing
2227,"Added two expenses and it already screwed up, wiping the debt for one person completely. Don't bother with it unless you want a complete hassle to sort out your debts 🙂"
2228,No option to add advance payments.
2229,garbage system. confusing and misleading
2230,Was working but now showing simple calculations incorrectly.
2231,Terribly buggy and difficult to understand
2232,The worst app update. Just hire good ui developers. The old vesrion was better than this. Imma going to unistall this.
2233,Very poor experience. No traceability of transactions.
2234,There no option to leave or delete the group.
2235,"Worst app, it runied our 15 years of friendship and many beautiful memories."
2236,The app will crash again and again
2237,Wow your calculations have gone insane. Used to trust your algorithm but you are making too many mistakes now. E.g how can 136-28 be 80 with no other expenses on the group. Srsly get a grip
2238,The New UI seems horrible. Didn't like it.
2239,"The update is worst .... don't show one of my friend in a list, it never happen before but this update have this problem ...i think the previous update was good .we can directly see all the expenses while opening the app ...if this will not solve we will leave this platform ..."
2240,"I edit app, but it instead got deleted which I wouldn't know till other members in group said it."
2241,App is crashing again and again
2242,What did you guys do with the last updated! looks and feels absolutely awful!
2243,"Appears to *require* each person to have an account. I would like to use to calculate for my own tracking with another person who doesn't do apps. This is common when I travel too, a couple of us will track things while another might be tech incompetent or just flakey. I should be able to put in a non-active person to split with, give me the option to add their email and share with them later"
2244,"This app was perfect, until they came up with the new UX update. Now I cringe using it. -2 stars for unnecessary UX update."
2245,New update just complicated stuff. Worst update
2246,Terrible app. Doesn't have the option to settle up individual expenses. Every time an expense is added it gets mushroomed into a collasal amount. Why make things so complicated?
2247,Unable to install the app... It's loading since long.... I have used this app last year it was working fine but today it's not working... Any maintenance going on???
2248,Thought I canceled but they still charged me. I tried to message them for a refund and silence. It was only a few days after being charged but still nothing.
2249,Very confusing. Once a payment is made there is no way to look back was it the amount really owed?
2250,Splitwise was working fine earlier however now it aborts unexpectedly after I try to open. Not able to use at all. So will not like to recommend anyone..
2251,"Very confusing interface that isn't intuitive to use at all. I can't tell who I'm supposed to pay or how to access the ""Settle Up"" function at most points. I just aimlessly tap around until I eventually find it. In a large group, bugs are causing payments to go to the wrong individuals, while requests are being sent from people who are not owed money (I have confirmed with these individuals that they did not send the requests). In theory this app should be great, but in practice it's awful."
2252,"Bad interface, not intuitive. This app doesn't do anything you couldn't do with pen and paper, but is unnecessarily complicated. Edit: I complained before because I couldn't remove my duplicate from a group. Now I'm back in the group (after leaving, deleting my account and reinstalling). Was fine at first, next day the balances I owe are completely different! Like I'm being charged interest? No one in group made any changes, the grocery totals are same. Friend has same issue. We're all baffled."
2253,New update sucks and not a user friendly. I have been using this for 5-6 years now but now it's interface is not user friendly and helpful. Didn't like the update this time. They should not try anything they had their own USP but now that is gone.
2254,"this app almost was the end off our friendship. I advise everyone to stay away from it as much as possible. Clear things out in person instead of using Splitwise and I promise you your friendship will benefit from it! None of us understood how the calculations worked, there is some serious black magic going on in this app! One friend almost died from a heart attack, trying to figure it out."
2255,"Sptiwise pro is having very bad features. when ever you try to scan a bill its always say that total amount is not identify please scan again. I have become pro user only for that particular feature and they just spoiled it. preciously i was a fan of splitwise but once i purchased pro, I made my mind. Don't become pro is just waste your hard earn money."
2256,Paid for pro - charged monthly but not getting benefits of pro. Have gotten no recourse to get my money back. Tried to cancel subscription through Google play as suggested but it's not on any of my google accounts.
2257,"The format is just not conducive ends up making things messier, would anytimw prefer taking manual notes over using this app."
2258,At beinging it was good but now it is all messed up. When we add a new expense in our group one will be charged all and others will not be charged. We were not able to add expenses because of this trouble. We are so sad to write this review at first it was incredible but now.....it caused trouble a lot
2259,No option to download attached image. Previous version has better UI.
2260,"It's not possible to edit the email address for friends in splitwise. Even when deleting a friend and recreating the contact with a new email address, the app still reverts to the old address. So I can't use this app for some of my contacts whose email addresses have changed."
2261,"I was really looking forward to using this app, but it is terrible. It literally only divides for you by the number of people. My google spreadsheet can at least make it where people don't have to send 4 transactions to balance something out. It should be able to allow people to send minimal transactions to balance out what is owed."
2262,Foolish app. It messes up with your expenses . You just can't trust this app because if you lost track of money and if the expenses gets messed up. You get in trouble man. I don't think this makes my life easier. Its better to write your expenses in diary rather then using this.
2263,"For crying out loud this needs the option to add users to a bill without them being a contact or sending them an invite. I should just be able to type a name and not need to invite them. They are probably going to say it improves the service or something like that, but it's not optional, it's obligatory, if you don't give options it doesn't improve the service. This seriously makes it unusable for me since I don't want want to bother a friend with an invite everytime I add an expense."
2264,"Wrong amount!!!! I have calculated it manually and manual whereby other that should owe me 500++ ended up only 300++. This has happened so many times that I doubted the amount. Only recently when I calculated (when the transaction is easier to calculate), then only realised a bug in the app. So should I have trust issue for very record??"
2265,I can't check the individual expense breakdown for the total amount that I need to settle up. Nor can I mark individual expenses as paid. That's dumb.
2266,"I have been using this app for past few months, but recently I found that the app is not splitting the amount among other members. While creating a transaction record, the amount is shown to be split but when we check the people who owe us, it shows wrong information. Because of this issue, cannot trust this app anymore."
2267,very bad app. i started using it because it was free. now they have made basic features paid. can't even search old transactions when it used to be free. cheating. earlier searching transactions was free and other features. if they want to make things paid then they should do that only for new transactions. decided to stop using it after 3 years. see alternatives.
2268,"It's UI (some tiles) is difficult to use, everytime i confused while using, it's ux slight to be improve for easy use."
2269,No option to delete account
2270,This app shows wrong calculations.
2271,Doesn't let you explicitly set Venmo username on your account. Which creates a terrible payment user experience. Venmo money sent to non existing account. And then having to reverse it. I don't understand why it's not possible to set your Venmo username. This garbage user experience
2272,No option to add advance payments.
2273,I got automatically logged out and couldn't log back in. Idk if it's down. I'll update if problem gets solved
2274,"The format is just not conducive ends up making things messier, would anytimw prefer taking manual notes over using this app."
2275,The premium feature add not additional value the UI is garbage for charts
2276,Ghatiya
2277,Gave wrong balance numbers and entries just disappeared out of nowhere. DONT INSTALL!!!
2278,Some time expense show in different person account... So many bugs.
2279,Can't update group photos on Pixel 4a
2280,Too much lagging now a days. Notification comes first and the update of the entry takes more than 2 minutes. Edited: Issue fixed. New UI is not insightful. Needs more improvement.
2281,I experienced a bug plz correct it asap
2282,There no option to leave or delete the group.
2283,"I edit app, but it instead got deleted which I wouldn't know till other members in group said it."
2284,Shite
2285,Update is not good.
2286,So utterly confusing
2287,Faltu
2288,In Group Expenses there should be an option of viewing every group members expenses seperately. In the current application I can see total group expenses and only my expense. There should be a provision of viewing contribution of each group members by a single click.
2289,Bhaii sahab....jab se ye app install kiya hai..18000 ke karze mein aa gaya...bhuka nanga ghoom raha prr karza nhii utar rahaa...kidney bech ke (dost ki) karzaa utarne chala tha...prr kidney bhi ek hi nikli..😢😢

Update (Reason for 1 star): Changed the UI in negative terms. Earlier UI and features were simple , minimalistic. Font size was large earlier. Now font size reduced and entire UI became pathetic"
2355,"I really dislike the new interface - Splitwise has been a well loved and well used app of mine for years now. Having gotten used to the old interface for so long, it had the same sudden shock of transition from Windows 7 to 8, and it's made everything harder than it was before. Why fix something that's not broken?"
2356,I liked the previous UI much better. It would be great if you can make can option to switch UIs
2357,The app is getting crashed every second i open it.
2358,New update sucks and not a user friendly. I have been using this for 5-6 years now but now it's interface is not user friendly and helpful. Didn't like the update this time. They should not try anything they had their own USP but now that is gone.
2359,"New update is really disappointing. Not easily understand. Even whiteboard option is also missing which helps to add the important notes for the group. Please revert back, I lost the saved notes."
2360,Wrong calculations
2361,"The recent update is making me consider delete the app. The previous version was cleaner, more user friendly and I was recommended to everyone! Please make the older and new version an option. I really enjoy your app, but if don't change anything about this new version, I'll move to another app, I'm sorry :("
2362,"App can not sync any data , they show internet connection is poor, anf i also uninstall the app and reinstall the app, login not work. Worse experience day by day."
2363,New update giving me headache Everytime if i add new expense app automatically crashing
2364,Great now I hate my roommate 😒
2365,In android this app is making bso much complications
2366,The app will crash again and again
2367,App sent notifications to other members before I was ready wish there was a private function so that I could set it up before sending it to other trip mates
2368,Updated 6/29/21 - Got used to having this app track expensesand bills. Bank account updated their software and now this app can't connect to it anymore. Now I can't even see what bills are coming up because I can't use the app at all without reconnecting to my bank through this app.
2369,"Most merchant names from my institutions came in as wrong and every transaction needed changing manually - both name and category. Unlike other systems I have used, there is no way to then recognize all future transactions from that merchant should be named and categorized that way. Apply to All resulted in EVERY transaction from that financial institution being renamed and categorized. Support wanted me to do their legwork + call AMEX to improve data from their partners. Um no. Cancel."
2370,It's honestly much nicer than some other apps I've tried but it is useless if your paycheck is irregular. Also they act like your profile information is vital but... this is not a social media app. They need that info for data mining and advertisements. All in all I found this app to be more exploitive than helpful.
2371,This app has a lot of inaccuracies. When I set up my monthly bills it is not tracking them accurately and shows them past due when it's already come out of my account. Also it does not know how to handle the transactions for your credit card ignores the transactions from your main checking account
2372,Yet another rubbish budgeting app that doesn't actually work.
2373,Started out great but then it stopped linking and displaying my transactions. I tried for over a week multiple times to contact support and no one ever got back to me. Finally I canceled. The next day someone from support contacted me and said their problem was resolved and after prying I got them to give me a free month. One month later they doubled their prices... hmm these guys don't even have their software or support really figured out and they are doubling their prices? I'm going elsewhere
2374,"Everything was going great the first week or so but my primary bank account couldn't sync up with the app and I tried multiple times for days until I finally contacted support. I gave support the information they needed and no one has gotten back to since then so I'm done 😒 you have to pay for all the good stuff anyways, not worth it!"
2375,"I can't add my bank account. Multiple days now I just get ""error 102"" please try again in 2 hours. Slightly useless at this point, can't even judge the app"
2376,"App would be great if accounts synced. Unfortunately, that's not the case and my bank account is constantly errored out."
2377,it refuses to operate unless you give them access to all of your banking accounts. Which by the way authorizes them to conduct transactions on your behalf. No thanks I'd like to keep my money that's why I'm trying to get a good budgeting app
2378,"Not paying ridiculous cost for ""plus"" just to have normal functionality"
2379,I would rate this higher if support actually responded to my repeated messages about being unable to add additional accounts. I see other people get replies to their reviews. Is anyone ever going to get back to me?
2380,"Team, I am a first user. Heard good reviews online but the app is unable to connect to accounts. Such bad start, need to remove app now. It's useless"
2381,Couldn't connect Citibank
2382,Loved this app until it no longer worked with my bank Synovus. I purchased it at the holiday price and within 3 months it no longer synced to my bank. They wouldn't provide even a partial refund either. It's the only app that I've found that shows you how much you spend out of the extra money of the month. You can see your pocket money getting less and less with more spending and that's what I need but they can't get the sync issues resolved. Don't get it if you bank with Synovus.
2383,Frustrating App!! This app was rated as one of the 10 best! I have not been able to experience this because I can't even get passed the sign up process. I have been trying to link my bank account to this app for several days now each with 15 attempts or more at least to do so. I have tried my phone as well as my tablet to connect with no success. I think I will move on to the next one on the 10 best apps list!!!
2384,"The ideas behind the app are sound and the simplicity is really nice, but upgrading adds little to no additional features. It took several months to not require manually reconnecting banking information, there was a bug that caused some duplication of transactions (that has yet to be cleaned up) and generally a lack of some basic features make this app little better than a spreadsheet. The main reason I am deleting is due to the horriblely non responsive customer service."
2385,"Do not recommend. This app has become unusable for me starting July, where my Chase credit card transactions will appear, disappear for a week, then maybe come back. This makes it so that the calculated expenses per month unreliable. They are blaming it on the Chase API and/or the 3rd party that returns duplicate transactions. Well guess what? I don't care. It's been 6 months and they are just going to let this major bug sit there. It is not usable if you use Chase for anything money related."
2386,"I'm done with this app! So many intermittent glitches that I can't just trust what I see. Oftentimes when you go into one month to look at the breakdown of purchases in a certain category, it shows purchases from a completely different month! For example, I go to January and open up ""groceries"" and it lists November's grocery purchases instead of January's??!! App is always out of sync. I wasted dozens of hours getting months worth of purchases categorized for nothing. Frustrating."
2387,"Can't even use the app. Can't do anything with the app unless you connect your account. It doesn't let me connect my account even though my bank is on their ""most popular"" banks list. Contacted their tech support just to be told ""our data aggregation partners are still working on your issue."" Thanks for trying but it's useless to me. DELETED. Let me know when the problems fixed. I'll update my review. Thanks."
2388,"Would have loved to try it. Unfortunately it forces you to link your financial accounts before you can even set up a budget or really look at the app at all. No way to manually manage an account (such as the cash in your own wallet), which is a feature I need for that anyway, and I also have no interest in linking my financial accounts until I determine whether I even like the app. Bummer"
2389,It was good until the app disconnected from my bank account about a week into use. When I try to send back in it said that my credentials were wrong double check with my bank it was perfectly fine. Send an email to support and still haven't gotten any feedback on it still can't use the app if I don't get help to use the app what's the point of having it?
2390,"I have requested numerous times a full refund for this app which never worked for me and they said, is not possible. To this date there is still an issue with my Chase account that wont sync and numerous issues with missing transactions, etc. I have many tickets opened and none have been resolved. I need a full refund now because I wont be using this app at all. Since day 1 with issues. The support has been poor. Responses take almost a week+. Not acceptable."
2391,"Fairly well designed app with some critical failings, namely the inability to split transactions across categories. Also: customer support does not respond. I made the mistake of buying the premium subscription, thinking it would add multi-category transactions. Developers never responded to several emails."
2392,"Pretty bummed, was super hopeful that this would get me away from spreadsheets. I downloaded this hoping to be able to View a true balance that factors in bills and savings goals. However, for this reason the app was useless. The number provided for daily budget was so far off based on the few parameters entered."
2393,"I enrolled in the free trial and quit using the app. it has been charging me monthly even though I never continued using it after initial setup. this app is a scam, caharging 3.99 a month. I deleted my account and I am hoping that it will discontinue the charges as there was no option to change my subscription service through the app. I am extremely disappointed."
2394,"Could not connect to my bank (102 and 170 errors). Tried every suggestion from their FAQ, my bank website, different browsers. Contacted their customer support and received one automated response they would answer soon but nothing. After 2 weeks, I went with a paid ($10/mo) budget app."
2395,"After contacting support I find out that I have to jump through hoops and it won't be as effective because I, like many in my work situation (retail employee), have a variable income. My hours, week to week, change as my employer schedules me on an 'as needed' basis, so... Won't do me a lick of good."
2396,This app used to be awesome. I'm a premium subscriber but have recently been having constant issues. I've reached out to the developers multiple times without a response. Disappointed.
2397,"I simply cannot get passed the account link phase. I will link account, then says to verify code via text. After that it says it is verifying, will do this for several minutes and suddenly stop. I've done this process about 10 times and no access."
2398,I tried adding accounts. Most wouldn't work even though they were on the list. Tried adding pay manually but it would automatically change the dates to sometime in the future instead of the day I selected. The app didn't work well overall.
2399,"I would love to even try this app but keep getting ""error 102"" connection failure whenever I try to add my bank accounts. Yes, I tried them both and they keep failing. Is there a solution?"
2400,Doesn't have features advertised. It doesn't even have basic things like a consolidation of credit card balance. Its nice to see everything big picture and it doesnt hit this mark.
2401,"Not enough access to all of my accounts. (No PayPal, no Varo Bank.) Income forecasting is ridiculous; assuming that my income is a set unchanging salary. It fluctuates with overtime, holidays, etc. It should work with what I've made and deposited, not an assumed set income amount."
2402,"Horrible experience, the app didn't allow my bank account and their tech team was not the best to deal with. They asked the same questions over and over or were non-responsive. It was a waste of time for me."
2403,"Had to reconnect to banks every day, which takes 5+ minutes. Complete waste of time. Would not recommend. Many other budgeting apps don't have this problem."
2404,The calcualtions are mismatched 2 months in a row(only subscribed for 2 months) due to missing transactions causing uncertainty as to where my finances actually are. This service is not what it was made out to be.
2405,I kept reading these issues have been solved but they haven't. I've had nothing but trouble connecting any and all accounts. Don't bother replying because the app has already been deleted. Why would I want something having this much trouble deal with my finances?
2406,Doesn't connect to my bank. Keep getting aggregation error message. Selected option to contact support and no response. Was excited about this app but I'm deleting it since it's useless if it can't link to my account to track my bills.
2407,"I was excited about this application, but it does not work with Amazon Synchrony bank. I am now obligated to delete everything and find one that does."
2408,It keeps saying my IP address is suspicious. It won't even let me create a new account even when I deleted the app and reinstalled it.
2409,Horrible app that did not deliver promised functions. Now stuck having spent 24 dollars for the premium version of an app that I can't use AND THEY REFUSED TO REFUND ME. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND BAD FOR MANAGING TRANSACTIONS.
2410,Won't even connect to santander. Just gives errors nonstop!!!!!
2411,"This will not connect with 5 out of 6 of my financial institutions. When I contacted support they said it was user error, I was entering the wrong credentials. False, how are my credentials going to work online when I sign into my account and not here? There is a problem with this application. Again when I contacted support letting them know I had verified my credentials (I don't use a password manager, I actually know my account info) they came back with the same answer, my problem. Junk"
2412,Great design poorly implemented. A very disappointing experience. Paying for plus to track Cash bills is a rip off.
2413,Doesn't work properly with Lastpass and gave me errors when I tried to connect my bank accounts. Useless for me unfortunately.
2414,Many other finance apps let you budget without connecting to a bank account. This app does not. No good!
2415,"This app won't connect with my accounts, I get notifications days after a transaction has occurred, and BEWARE: if you delete your account the company will harass you. Steer clear."
2416,"Was excited about this service but i cant even create an account or log in, even on the website. Guess I'll find something else."
2417,"Save your money. Look for another program. One of my MAJOR bank cards, WILL NOT RECONNECT. Support has NOT BEEN ANY HELP. Plus the negative cash dollars in ""your wallet"" does not make any since. This app is a MAJOR LET DOWN. ****RESPONSE****WHEN I PAYED FOR MY YEAR SUBSCRIPTION. IT SYNC'D TO PAYPAL"
2418,Nice design but could not connect to my bank due to an Aggregation error and customer service never respomded.
2419,"Didn't even get started. Can't do anything without connecting your accounts. Want to get in and look at it before setting that up, can't. Uninstalled before even using."
2420,Was great but after the update it had missed A LOT of transactions which makes it pretty useless.
2421,Paid for plus account but now it has stopped syncing with my accounts. No word back from support.
2422,Why every budgeting app wants you to link your back account. Give people the option to use your app with out linking! Uninstalled.
2423,Uninstalled after a week of finding it confusing and useless.
2424,This app is a POS. I couldn't even connect my account.
2425,Doesn't work with One Finance
2426,Doesn't show current info on my bank account I might as well just go off my bank app I see no purpose to this if I can't get current information on my accounts
2427,won't connect to bank anymore and emailing support doesn't do much
2428,Didnt have to wait long to receive an error connction priblem
2429,cant even use the stupid app because it says to update but there is no update feature. wth
2430,complete waste of alot of time. balances never update. these people dont know what they are doing
2431,App doesn't sync info accurately not easy to use
2432,Couldn't even connect to my bank.
2433,My bank account was hacked less that 12 hours after I got the app. Can't figure how to cancel my account on this app. My last review was deleted.
2434,I would like to budget without being forced to link my bank account.
2435,Doesn't work with RBC. Impossible to use.
2436,Required to connect bank accounts.
2437,only works with defined bank accounts. So no.
2438,Could you please add Horizon Credit Union so I can use your app
2439,Can't use without a bank account
2440,Not for me
2441,you have to link your bank accounts....not what i wanted
2442,"how can i delete my account and email? i didnt link my bank yet, but i want to delete my email and not use this app and not have your company have my information."
2443,"Hated, do not installed"
2444,"Best budgeting app out there in my opinion, when it works that is. More often then not, can't connect to my bank. Each time there's an issue with their data provider. You would think that they would switch to a different provider like Plaid, but maybe it's just Canadian banks that keep breaking."
2445,doesnt work
2446,"This app can be described in two words ""Aggregation error."" I used it for nearly a year hoping it would improve, but it's ability to connect to your various accounts is too inconsistent to make it worth it. I'll be looking elsewhere for this service."
2447,"It's been 15 days since it's updated my bank account balance and transactions. 15 days!! What's the point of having an app that tracks your bank accounts if it's not going to do that? That's the one feature that I got this app for and it fails miserably in that ever important aspect.. My bank is Bank of America, so it's not even a small bank."
2448,"Can't run without syncing to a bank account, but they don't offer my bank effectively making it useless."
2449,"If it wasn't so slow, it might be a nice app. What ""shouldn't take more 
than a minute..."" was taking 10. I dont have time to set up each of my 
accounts at 10 mins a piece. Would love to love it but never made it past 
my 1st account setup."
2450,"Nothing simple about it. After importing tons of info, and marking income 
and bills, the app doesn't recognize new transactions properly and doesn't 
count them towards the correct categories. When I try to correct the errors 
it just deletes the category altogether and I have to set it up all over 
again. What's the point of trying to track stuff if I could do it easier on 
paper?"
2451,"Doesn't work unless you have a US bank account that you can link with the 
app."
2452,Useless app. I try to add my income it tells me no transactions found. I try to add a bill it tells me no transactions found. I try to add it manually but I have to upgrade to the plus version. Don't waste your time with this app.
2453,"Won't even let me link my accounts. Waste of time, not bothering with it."
2454,Force you to add bank account
2455,Can't use app without allowing access to bank account. Should not be a necessity.
2456,"Asks me random security questions to connect my bank account, so I can't connect it. Therefore I can't use the app"
2457,"Why pull back existing features from your users, like the more refined categories for expenses, and ask them to pay to get them back? Especially after investing a lot of time into making sure everything was clustered well. This is just terrible user experience… except if you are in the drug dealing business, of course…"
2458,"After installing and connecting to my account, i couldnt add my own bills or expenses. They obky wanted to use what was in my online bank accounts."
2459,"Added my bank just fine, but then failed to add my paypal account. When trying to set up my income sources, it didn't even provide an option to ""add"" any, but instead listed the money deposits from my bank account, assuming those were my only income, and ONLY allowed me to choose from those! So I can't make cash for income? On top of all the INCREDIBLY personal questions it FORCES you to answer to even set it up (net worth, etc), this one is a *HARD PASS.* This app is not good. EDIT REPLYING TO DEV RESPONSE: I don't download apps to help developers fix them, i download them to USE them. I have my own things to do every day. This app sucks."
2460,"Installed app and it ran well up until the point I put in all my info. At the point I chose which transactions were bills, recurring fee etc. It crashed and has not opened since. Repeat error that app has closed restart app. Upon restart I get error close app. Kind of pointless if the app can't be used or even opened for that matter."
2461,This sucks. I can't even get past adding my address to use the app. And I'm clicking on the prompted address within the app.
2462,"I have spent 3 days trying to connect my accounts to no success. It constantly sits there in the 'Connecting and Synchronizing' screen; one connected right, another connected but says it can't obtain all transaction data, and 4 other institutions continue to stall out. I don't have the patience to diagnose this nuisance further than I already have."
2463,Couldn't even add account number 1
2464,Random named transactions...  Had about 15 items all saying Netflix.    Not staying synced to my bank account and several days behind when it is.    Please fix it.   Was awesome but not anymore.
2465,"Does not sync since update, otherwise it was one of the best, if not the best out there. I now end up using a combination of other apps. When this gets fixed ill update my rating. Otherwise its useless... Pending transactions still not fixed after emails and prompt responses, sadly ill be moving on."
2466,"The app won't sync with any of my accounts. It set up just fine initially, though. I spent at least an hour adding all of my accounts, bills, income, etc. Now, after I got everything set up, the app has stopped syncing and won't do anything. Don't waste your time."
2467,Cannot reconnect any of my account after update. App is now useless. Uninstalled.   Related: blog hasn't been updated since April. Don't see this company sticking around.
2468,"The app seemed promising, but once I was logged in and set up I realized you can do absolutely nothing unless you subscribe. I don't mind doing that, but when opting in for a free trial it still wanted to charge me for the month. Also, you have to manually add in all income. Still need some work."
2469,"Most merchant names from my institutions came in as wrong and every transaction needed changing manually - both name and category. Unlike other systems I have used, there is no way to then recognize all future transactions from that merchant should be named and categorized that way. Apply to All resulted in EVERY transaction from that financial institution being renamed and categorized. Support wanted me to do their legwork + call AMEX to improve data from their partners. Um no.

2507,"Could not connect to my bank (102 and 170 errors). Tried every suggestion from their FAQ, my bank website, different browsers. Contacted their customer support and received one automated response they would answer soon but nothing. After 2 weeks, I went with a paid ($10/mo) budget app."
2508,"I'm done with this app! So many intermittent glitches that I can't just trust what I see. Oftentimes when you go into one month to look at the breakdown of purchases in a certain category, it shows purchases from a completely different month! For example, I go to January and open up ""groceries"" and it lists November's grocery purchases instead of January's??!! App is always out of sync. I wasted dozens of hours getting months worth of purchases categorized for nothing. Frustrating."
2509,Paid for plus account but now it has stopped syncing with my accounts. No word back from support.
2510,"I would love to even try this app but keep getting ""error 102"" connection failure whenever I try to add my bank accounts. Yes, I tried them both and they keep failing. Is there a solution?"
2511,"Fairly well designed app with some critical failings, namely the inability to split transactions across categories. Also: customer support does not respond. I made the mistake of buying the premium subscription, thinking it would add multi-category transactions. Developers never responded to several emails."
2512,I would like to budget without being forced to link my bank account.
2513,"Do not recommend. This app has become unusable for me starting July, where my Chase credit card transactions will appear, disappear for a week, then maybe come back. This makes it so that the calculated expenses per month unreliable. They are blaming it on the Chase API and/or the 3rd party that returns duplicate transactions. Well guess what? I don't care. It's been 6 months and they are just going to let this major bug sit there. It is not usable if you use Chase for anything money related."
2514,Can't use without a bank account
2515,"Save your money. Look for another program. One of my MAJOR bank cards, WILL NOT RECONNECT. Support has NOT BEEN ANY HELP. Plus the negative cash dollars in ""your wallet"" does not make any since. This app is a MAJOR LET DOWN. ****RESPONSE****WHEN I PAYED FOR MY YEAR SUBSCRIPTION. IT SYNC'D TO PAYPAL"
2516,My bank account was hacked less that 12 hours after I got the app. Can't figure how to cancel my account on this app. My last review was deleted.
2517,Why every budgeting app wants you to link your back account. Give people the option to use your app with out linking! Uninstalled.
2518,Horrible app that did not deliver promised functions. Now stuck having spent 24 dollars for the premium version of an app that I can't use AND THEY REFUSED TO REFUND ME. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND BAD FOR MANAGING TRANSACTIONS.
2519,Uninstalled after a week of finding it confusing and useless.
2520,won't connect to bank anymore and emailing support doesn't do much
2521,It was good until the app disconnected from my bank account about a week into use. When I try to send back in it said that my credentials were wrong double check with my bank it was perfectly fine. Send an email to support and still haven't gotten any feedback on it still can't use the app if I don't get help to use the app what's the point of having it?
2522,Doesn't have features advertised. It doesn't even have basic things like a consolidation of credit card balance. Its nice to see everything big picture and it doesnt hit this mark.
2523,"Didn't even get started. Can't do anything without connecting your accounts. Want to get in and look at it before setting that up, can't. Uninstalled before even using."
2524,"After contacting support I find out that I have to jump through hoops and it won't be as effective because I, like many in my work situation (retail employee), have a variable income. My hours, week to week, change as my employer schedules me on an 'as needed' basis, so... Won't do me a lick of good."
2525,App doesn't sync info accurately not easy to use
2526,"Horrible experience, the app didn't allow my bank account and their tech team was not the best to deal with. They asked the same questions over and over or were non-responsive. It was a waste of time for me."
2527,"Pretty bummed, was super hopeful that this would get me away from spreadsheets. I downloaded this hoping to be able to View a true balance that factors in bills and savings goals. However, for this reason the app was useless. The number provided for daily budget was so far off based on the few parameters entered."
2528,"This app won't connect with my accounts, I get notifications days after a transaction has occurred, and BEWARE: if you delete your account the company will harass you. Steer clear."
2529,complete waste of alot of time. balances never update. these people dont know what they are doing
2530,Nice design but could not connect to my bank due to an Aggregation error and customer service never respomded.
2531,"This app can be described in two words ""Aggregation error."" I used it for nearly a year hoping it would improve, but it's ability to connect to your various accounts is too inconsistent to make it worth it. I'll be looking elsewhere for this service."
2532,cant even use the stupid app because it says to update but there is no update feature. wth
2533,doesnt work
2534,I tried adding accounts. Most wouldn't work even though they were on the list. Tried adding pay manually but it would automatically change the dates to sometime in the future instead of the day I selected. The app didn't work well overall.
2535,only works with defined bank accounts. So no.
2536,Frustrating App!! This app was rated as one of the 10 best! I have not been able to experience this because I can't even get passed the sign up process. I have been trying to link my bank account to this app for several days now each with 15 attempts or more at least to do so. I have tried my phone as well as my tablet to connect with no success. I think I will move on to the next one on the 10 best apps list!!!
2537,Great design poorly implemented. A very disappointing experience. Paying for plus to track Cash bills is a rip off.
2538,"how can i delete my account and email? i didnt link my bank yet, but i want to delete my email and not use this app and not have your company have my information."
2539,I kept reading these issues have been solved but they haven't. I've had nothing but trouble connecting any and all accounts. Don't bother replying because the app has already been deleted. Why would I want something having this much trouble deal with my finances?
2540,Doesn't connect to my bank. Keep getting aggregation error message. Selected option to contact support and no response. Was excited about this app but I'm deleting it since it's useless if it can't link to my account to track my bills.
2541,"I enrolled in the free trial and quit using the app. it has been charging me monthly even though I never continued using it after initial setup. this app is a scam, caharging 3.99 a month. I deleted my account and I am hoping that it will discontinue the charges as there was no option to change my subscription service through the app. I am extremely disappointed."
2542,you have to link your bank accounts....not what i wanted
2543,"Can't even use the app. Can't do anything with the app unless you connect your account. It doesn't let me connect my account even though my bank is on their ""most popular"" banks list. Contacted their tech support just to be told ""our data aggregation partners are still working on your issue."" Thanks for trying but it's useless to me. DELETED. Let me know when the problems fixed. I'll update my review. Thanks."
2544,"Was excited about this service but i cant even create an account or log in, even on the website. Guess I'll find something else."
2545,Could you please add Horizon Credit Union so I can use your app
2546,Many other finance apps let you budget without connecting to a bank account. This app does not. No good!
2547,"I simply cannot get passed the account link phase. I will link account, then says to verify code via text. After that it says it is verifying, will do this for several minutes and suddenly stop. I've done this process about 10 times and no access."
2548,"Can't run without syncing to a bank account, but they don't offer my bank effectively making it useless."
2549,"It's been 15 days since it's updated my bank account balance and transactions. 15 days!! What's the point of having an app that tracks your bank accounts if it's not going to do that? That's the one feature that I got this app for and it fails miserably in that ever important aspect.. My bank is Bank of America, so it's not even a small bank."
2550,"If it wasn't so slow, it might be a nice app. What ""shouldn't take more 
than a minute..."" was taking 10. I dont have time to set up each of my 
accounts at 10 mins a piece. Would love to love it but never made it past 
my 1st account setup."
2551,"App was not what I was looking for. Canceled subscription and uninstalled 
but still being charged!"
2552,"Does not add various know financial entities as PayPal, needed to sync 
absolutely everything to be useful, otherwise it defends the purpose having 
to check more than one place for totals"
2553,"Nothing simple about it. After importing tons of info, and marking income 
and bills, the app doesn't recognize new transactions properly and doesn't 
count them towards the correct categories. When I try to correct the errors 
it just deletes the category altogether and I have to set it up all over 
again. What's the point of trying to track stuff if I could do it easier on 
paper?"
2554,"Doesn't work unless you have a US bank account that you can link with the 
app."
2555,"Was not able to link any of my accounts. Normally I would just uninstall 
apps like this, except apparently the people who run this app _really_ want 
engagement. I got at least 3 emails and around 10 notifications from this 
PoS before I finally got rid of it. Avoid at all costs, or at least sign up 
with a fake email and disable notifications"
2556,So hard to enter things. I wanted my mortgage to be a recurring bill and kept asking me if i want it removed.
2557,"Won't even let me link my accounts. Waste of time, not bothering with it."
2558,"Why should I have to make an account? Too much BS. Just let me make a comprehensive list of expenses and bills and income.  (Reply) I don't appreciate that at all. Not only is that just another point of possible security failure (a massive one if you ask me) when it comes to my important personal and private information that no third party has any business with, it's also an annoyance to me as I want full control over the information that goes into any budget app. I have since found exactly what I need from a different app."
2559,Useless app. I try to add my income it tells me no transactions found. I try to add a bill it tells me no transactions found. I try to add it manually but I have to upgrade to the plus version. Don't waste your time with this app.
2560,Force you to add bank account
2561,I can't download it to my phone!
2562,Can't use app without allowing access to bank account. Should not be a necessity.
2563,"Great idea in concept, but couldn't link due to 'aggregation' error. After multiple attempts to contact customer service over the course of 2 weeks with no response, gave up. Didn't work at all as a result and was a waste of time."
2564,"Asks me random security questions to connect my bank account, so I can't connect it. Therefore I can't use the app"
2565,"Why pull back existing features from your users, like the more refined categories for expenses, and ask them to pay to get them back? Especially after investing a lot of time into making sure everything was clustered well. This is just terrible user experience… except if you are in the drug dealing business, of course…"
2566,"After installing and connecting to my account, i couldnt add my own bills or expenses. They obky wanted to use what was in my online bank accounts."
2567,"Added my bank just fine, but then failed to add my paypal account. When trying to set up my income sources, it didn't even provide an option to ""add"" any, but instead listed the money deposits from my bank account, assuming those were my only income, and ONLY allowed me to choose from those! So I can't make cash for income? On top of all the INCREDIBLY personal questions it FORCES you to answer to even set it up (net worth, etc), this one is a *HARD PASS.* This app is not good. EDIT REPLYING TO DEV RESPONSE: I don't download apps to help developers fix them, i download them to USE them. I have my own things to do every day. This app sucks."
2568,Would have been a five star review but yesterday the virtual card on my partners app was hacked. Repeat purchases were made at target in large quantities until the balance on our joint account was $0. There is no fraud alert or policies in place to auto lock the card and stop suspicious purchases. Called customer service and was told we have to call back when the charges are no longer pending to report it and then there is a 45-90 day investigation period before we get our money back. NO THANKS
2569,It won't let me open it. It keeps telling me to resubmit in a few minutes. I haven't been able to check my bills at all. I've even tried Uninstalling it. Please fix!
2570,Constantly having an issue with this app from unexplained purchases to them continually logging us out of our accounts it's getting tiring
2571,"- Couldn't add a bank account - non intuitive interface with no information on what it means ""which device"". Asked support for help and haven't heard back in 2 weeks. - App non responsive on first time use when data sync happens"
2572,I have been using this app for a couple of years and love it but due to recent updates it will no longer work on my tablet. I have contacted support and received no answers as to why tablets were removed. I still use the app but unfortunatly I have to use an android emulator on my pc to use it. If tablet support comes back I will gladly change my review because it has the potetial to be the best couples money managing app. Update still has not been resolved.
2573,I think its a great ide. But its qay not accurate. I try to refresh it and its been 8 days since the last update shows the wrong balances and purchases. Like i said would be great but doesnt work. Going online to your bank and seeing what you have done is easier. Uninstalling after having it for a month.
2574,"This is a great app for organizing various accounts with your partner. However, a major drawback is the ads/articles posted under the 'Activity' tab. Under that tab I should be able to quickly see a summary of all activity on all linked accounts. But no, I have to sift through these unrelated ads/articles to find my activity. It's usually nestled in between the articles or all the way at the bottom. As far as I can tell, there are no settings to change this. Considering different apps bc of this"
2575,"Buggy. I have tried to make three separate actions on this app 1. Add my bank account. 2. Add line item budgeting 3. Contact customer service. All three have had different bugs from closing the out to app entirely to telling me the action won't work to try again later. Will be uninstalling. Chances are if you need this app, you're financially stressed and the bug issues absolutely do not help. I never got to experience what this app does bc I can't even get past the set up without issues."
2576,"Not accommodating to anything you would seek an app like this for in the first place! Joint function is a gimmick, nothing else works. My CC accounts always somehow fail to ""respond"" in order to sync. And it supports Chime Checking/Savings, but gives zero acknowledgement of the credit builder account they offer alongside those, which is mainly intended to be used in place of checking, and is amazing. So neither me or my SO can use this since it doesn't give us accurate/relevant figures at all."
2577,"Can't believe this is an ""Editors Choice""!!! My checking only showed spending, not deposits. Thought it might be my bank. Could not find any way to manually enter my deposits (checking or cash), or cash spending. I emailed support, and have waited over a week without a response. The app is worthless, and I can't believe I trusted them with my banking information."
2578,"Major issues for me personally. I've had no luck linking my bank and the app. The app gets confused and asks for information prematurely. Information you could only see if your accounts are successfully linked. It's difficult to explain...which is probably why I have been ghosted by customer service for the last few days. Last I heard the engineering team was looking to fix the issue? Who knows? Seems to me this app just wasn't ready to be released, and has been playing ""catch up"" ever since."
2579,"So the app itself is not terrible, I wish more to inform everyone to stay away from the banking option they have rolled out. I've tried using it one time so far via sending some money with my direct deposit, unfortunately I cannot tell you anything past that point due to the horrendous and awful service. The money did not show up so I called customer service just to be rum around because the information to verify my account, which I was reading from the app, was incorrect. I do not recommend."
2580,"OK, this app does not in any form allow for a budget. Unless I am missing something. The UI is way to complicated. You cant seem to do anything without syncing your cards and checking account. It should be called a money tracker, not a budget planner. A budget is created for different categories. Then each item adjusted for each category as money is removed. Not helpful, unless you have zero experience with book keeping."
2581,"Haven't been able to connect my accounts for months. Robinhood and vanguard haven't been able to connect for months. I reached out to support multiple times since March and received the same exact response everytime. ""This issue is affecting many users, we will reach out with an update"". Useless. And it's frustrating not being able to connect"
2582,"this app was perfect until until it crashed today. I tried to open the app multiple times all day and it wouldn't allow me, it just wouldn't open kept crashing. I then contacted the customer service via email and they said they would look into it. But nothing has changed . If they fix this I'll change it to 5 star because i did enjoy using this app alot."
2583,"I'm hoping this is something app creators can fix, but ever since I downloaded this app I have not ever been able to get past the first 2 steps in the very beginning when it asks you for your name and an optional photo. I've tried selecting I will do later, I have tried uploading a pic, I've tried taking a pic, and, irregardless of which selection I make, step number 3, [for me] always takes me right back to step number 1. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app 2-3 times. IDEAS? HELP?"
2584,"It looks promising but unfortunately it continually said ""there is a problem connecting to the internet"" and both for me and my girlfriend it was saying this as well as that we did not pass the security check to connect our bank. I can't give any further opinion on this app since I didn't make it past this point and could not manually enter information. I think I'll stick with the more simple yet more effective budget calender app."
2585,horrible app glitches all the time. I spent half an hour trying to change a single transaction to the right category and it wouldn't update. finally uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now its asking for the 6 digit code it texted to me I put it in 5 times triple checked it was correct kept saying correct tried responding the code 4 times before just saying forget it and deleting the app. Great idea I just wish it actually worked.
2586,"Worked great at first. All the sudden it stopped working on my phone. Pixel 3 Android v11. First it stopped updating my bank account because of two factor on my bank. I got it connected back up, then it stopped showing transactions for my bank. Then it started crashing wherever I updated the transaction description on my wife's account. Uninstalled and reinstalled now it crashes everytime. Really like this app compared to others, if they can get it working right."
2587,"Seems like a great idea but fails to connect to any of the institutions listed, seems to be more of a data gatherer than anything. Shouldn't be release as it's obviously not ready to go live, chack out the other negative reviews to see the same issues again and again: won't connect to banks, loses all listed entries, fails to notify set dates etc etc"
2588,"Forget technical support I've tried for going on two months to contact someone so they could fix in are within the app and still nothing. If I could issue them 1/2 * I would. What a disappointment on a potentially user-friendly couples / budget app. And as far as asking for donations all the time, I wouldn't give you guys a pot to piss in."
2589,Lousy and useless. Worked for one day for both of us. Hasn't updated a single account since the day we installed it and added our bank/credit accounts (nearly two weeks ago). Completely left us in the lurch thinking we had more money in our checking accounts than we actually did. No one has even written me back about said issue. Entirely frustrating 😡
2590,"Everytime I open this app, it refreshes the data and I have to re-enter all of my information, re-enter my bills, re-invite my husband. It is the most annoying thing ever. Not worth the hassle, unless it gets fixed, then it's totally worth it"
2591,"1/31/19 - installed app and tried to register as a new user. got past the email verification but app would not advance past the photo upload page. pressing Next or skip for later would return to the ""what should we call you"" page. entering name goes back to photo page. tried deleting and reinstalling 3x. same issue. App appears to have potential if users could actually get to content"
2592,"This is a joke. There's no actual usable webpage, only the app so adding accounts is maddening. Banks where I have accounts and credit cards only show credit cards. Can't add your partner if they already have an account, can only invite them as a new user. Everything seems very poorly executed beneath the pretentious skin."
2593,"No Support or Customer Service. Have tried to link my accounts multiple times but the app was unsuccessful. When I tried to contact them through the app or email, my messages didn't get replies even after a week. Unless I enter my accounts manually, I'll have to look elsewhere for a working app."
2594,"The CIBC integration keeps on failing. I have found that opening the CIBC on my phone helps but sometimes it still fails to sync for a few days. I have e-mailed support on this and have not received a response. While I enjoy the app, if it does not sync it is pretty useless."
2595,"It was fine at the beginning but then suddenly stopped linking to my account. When I tried to re link it I kept getting error messages. Very disappointed as I had been thrilled to find out about this app. Emailed customer support, but no response"
2596,app gets stuck in an endless loop between uploading a photo and writting my name. Even after confirming my email it is still stuck in this loop. However during this time i was stuck in this stupid app I did not spend any money so it did work. Since writting this me and my girlfriend became so mad at the app we engaged in domestic voilence and are now breaking up. This will also help us save money since we'll be in jail. Thanks Honeydue!
2597,"I couldn't connect any of my bank accounts. And every time I switched apps to look up my passwords to fill in my login credentials the honey screen would add another set of username/password boxes, so I had 8 boxes after a few app switches; seems like there are a lot of bugs."
2598,"This is the worst banking app you can get imo. We got this app because we assumed it would be good as a way to organize our finances between the two of us. Over the last year or so, it has essentially become an advertisement for their own visa. Also, the metrics are absolutely bare bones."
2599,"horrible, so many signin issues, recover password again? ridiculous. have attempted to use this program 3 times in last year. never convenient. update: while i was contacted by honeydue, and signin problem solved, the app still will not update with accounts. has not updated since first day"
2600,I made an acount but it wouldn't allow me to connect my Usaa bank account. It says my security questions didn't match although none were asked. It asks for my usaa number. I enter that and still doesn't work. I can't say anything on how it works cause I couldn't get past the first step.
2601,"Can't get past the email verification. When I enter my email, when I click the email link, it sends me to the Play Store app page, and when I open the app it has me restart the process all over again. Terrible so far, please help!!"
2602,"Doesn't work for me. good concepts, but if I cant use it then what's the use, just wanted space on my phone. Guess I'll have to stick to saving receipts and checking my account manually."
2603,"The app won't allow us to add our bank account and manually adding in all our expenses just seems painful and a waste of time. Too bad we didn't even get to try this app out, it looked promising."
2604,"Not really a budgeting app, more of a spending tracker. I connected my bank accounts and they wont update throughout the day, so you cant track your real time spensing. Contacted support about it and no response."
2605,"No support for Ca$h App or Venmo?! Both apps send us a verification code, but yours doesn't have anywhere we can enter this code to move forward. Linking our ""regular"" bank accounts worked fine, but as we also use both of those other apps for payroll, bills & groceries, it's necessary for us to be able to add these as well to be able to use your features properly. I've already contacted support a week or 3 ago, but still haven't heard an update or solution to this issue🤷🏽‍♂"
2606,before I could check the app out it demanded a tip for each month. I had to enter a $ amount before I could go on. Deleated it immediately. Do not recomend it unless you have a lot of cash up to $10.00 each month.
2607,Works to show all your bank information with your spouse! BUT it never updates when you do any new transactions or get a deposit or anything! Don't install this!!
2608,"Unusable. It keeps switching to the activity page no matter how many times I tapped on the budget page. I can't work on the budget page at all, so what's the point of this app then?"
2609,"You can't do anything at all unless you give the app your bank account details. No budgeting, no transaction entry, nothing."
2610,"I've given up. After the removal of seeing all months in one view on transactions, and repeated requests to reconfirm my accounts, you've finally killed me. For some reason that l don't understand you've randomly logged me out of my account. And even though I've got the password right you want two-step verification to a mobile phone number I don't have. I'm not doing it anymore. I was using this app to manually track my debts. Now I have no idea because I can't log in to see my payments."
2611,"Stupid app - every screen is just a prompt to connect a bank account. I just want to see when my bills are due and keep track of them, not share my financial information."
2612,Me and my husband opened an joint account On here and now we can't seem to be able to close the account. and the support is not been any help what so ever. We did get our cards but can't now close the account please help.
2613,I wanted to use this app to budget but once I downloaded it and put my bank info in I had 2 emails within 2 days saying someone was trying to get into one of my accounts. I emailed customer service and received no response
2614,"POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT, DO NOT USE! I was unable to link my bank (Monzo), emailed support and havent heard anything back. Given up now, would not recommend. Recent update: I have heard from the support team, told me they would look into for me, said to give them a day or two, however this update is posted a week later, still with no response and still unable to use the app thanks to being unable to link my Monzo bank account. The app is now uninstalled."
2615,"Great concept if it worked. Out of the 4 major banks, it connects to one consistently."
2616,Forces you to add a bank account or credit card. No interest in handing that information over.
2617,"After over 40 years working I the tech industry, I build my first computer in 1975, I spent 2 hours trying to get my app to sync with my wife and not only did it not work we ended up upset with each other because she insisted this was the best app based on reviews. If it is they are smarter then me."
2618,The problem is the app is designed for you to use your bank account but what if you do not have one. Why can't you upload a fictitious account with the number you want and then use the budget based on that.
2619,"It only works if you don't mind sharing your personal banking information, and won't even let you create a budget without that. Uninstalling now...."
2620,Couldn't even connect to my partner after trying everything I could think of and the company suggestions Cant even change who you sent the partner invite to even though it says cancel Do not download
2621,"Wanted to use this app and set it up with my husband with very high expectations, although I am about to remove it because I cannot talk with anybody customer service."
2622,OK was really excited for my wife and I to try this....couldnt not get passed the adding my name portion. App timed out 4 times.
2623,I can receive notifications but I can't open the app on my phone. It always stops working when I try to load it.
2624,WARNING: We tried this app. A day later someone tried to get into our bank account. not sure if its connected or not. did take the chance and deleted it. It also was inaccurate to our bank account. User beware.
2625,I just want an app where I can manually enter in spending with my spouse. I dont want any app having access to my bank accounts or credit cards.
2626,Does not work offline. Why do u need 2 make an account 2 manage ur credit cards? Looking 4 something that works without an internet connection.
2627,"A hellishly complicated system to invite paetners. keeps popping up, ""email in use"". nonsense."
2628,"just uninstalled it, keeps asking for a code that was never sent even after I verified it in my email. I don't like complicated things."
2629,Unusable. Wont connect to either of my 2 bank accounts despite logging in and entering the OTP.
2630,The app doesnt send me any notifications. I have to go in the app to see what's due. It wont send reminders to me.
2631,"I live in Israel. Downloaded it just fine. Installed it just fine. My wife's phone is in Hebrew: ""Doesnt work in your country."" You are not worth the effort."
2632,"sign up. get a warning about a credit application on my credit report the next day. coincidence? maybe, but I personally don't trust it any more."
2633,I installed it but it did not let me sign up. Kept saying my email was expired. So had to Uninstall it.
2634,"Broken, can't even sign up. Keeps saying ""Oops: Duplicate"""
2635,Really wanted to use this but the connector gets stuck on every bank I try
2636,Tried it. Amounts are way off. Makes this app difficult to use. Sorry guys for me its a no from me.
2637,This was extremely anticlimactic. You had me going in the first half. I have no idea how to add my partner because i got ahead of myself. You did not explain it.
2638,"I want to test the app, without an account, that is unfortunately unavailable in this app. So bad, that you want my email and account creation, for a simple test."
2639,Can't even add my bank gets stuck on redirecting to plaid
2640,forcing us to sign up when every other app let's you login through a google account is a non starter
2641,would not connect to my bank account. I tried multiple times
2642,"Only supports US, Canadian dollars, pounds and euros, so it's of no use if you live in another country."
2643,None of the accounts linked are updating balances or even showing transactions. This isn't doing anything for anyone.
2644,Seems like good app but I wouldn't know if it worked since I can't add amounts... $$
2645,"account not syncing, work the first time you sync but not after that"
2646,I tried to get the security pin a couple of times via email but I'm not receiving any. Please help
2647,this app sucks. can't connect to bank.
2648,Couldn't Get The Code To Go In To Sign. To App.
2649,Not consistent in behavior. Doesn't connect to a popular bank and an investment firm.
2650,They are still getting money from my bank even though I've deactivated my account. I need them to CUT IT OUT. I allowed them to take out 2.14 a month to use the service but I'M NOT USING IT ANYMORE. STOP TAKING MY MONEY.
2651,This is the worst! So not user friendly. Extremely confusing.
2652,Your forced to attach your bank account to the app.... ANYTHING could happen.
2653,Won't load big name accounts keeps tell me I have the wrong username and passwords.
2654,works only with connected bank accounts
2655,deleted the app opted to tip $0 still charged me $2.11 are you kidding me?
2656,Not receiving the verification code for the registration.
2657,Doesn't work at all!
2658,why are my girlfriend's transactions still in the pending section? its been weeks now
2659,Chat experience blows. Sad.
2660,won't connect to my bank of America accounts. i have to uninstall
2661,Doesn't work
2662,wont even download for me
2663,I dont want ti have to create an account to use a bill pay reminder.
2664,PC Financial is unavailable
2665,Difficult to setup
2666,Can't link my bank accounts. Put your self together guys. Users are giving you a chance and you're failing
2667,Will not sync my bank accounts
2668,Cannot open the app. Always an error. Is this a bug? If so it needs fixed Pronto! I cant even check my balances online any other way and that also needs fixed.
2669,It won't let me open it. It keeps telling me to resubmit in a few minutes. I haven't been able to check my bills at all. I've even tried Uninstalling it. Please fix!
2670,Would have been a five star review but yesterday the virtual card on my partners app was hacked. Repeat purchases were made at target in large quantities until the balance on our joint account was $0. There is no fraud alert or policies in place to auto lock the card and stop suspicious purchases. Called customer service and was told we have to call back when the charges are no longer pending to report it and then there is a 45-90 day investigation period before we get our money back. NO THANKS
2671,"I've given up. After the removal of seeing all months in one view on transactions, and repeated requests to reconfirm my accounts, you've finally killed me. For some reason that l don't understand you've randomly logged me out of my account. And even though I've got the password right you want two-step verification to a mobile phone number I don't have. I'm not doing it anymore. I was using this app to manually track my debts. Now I have no idea because I can't log in to see my payments."
2672,Constantly having an issue with this app from unexplained purchases to them continually logging us out of our accounts it's getting tiring
2673,I just want an app where I can manually enter in spending with my spouse. I dont want any app having access to my bank accounts or credit cards.
2674,single
2675,Forces you to add a bank account or credit card. No interest in handing that information over.
2676,"No support for Ca$h App or Venmo?! Both apps send us a verification code, but yours doesn't have anywhere we can enter this code to move forward. Linking our ""regular"" bank accounts worked fine, but as we also use both of those other apps for payroll, bills & groceries, it's necessary for us to be able to add these as well to be able to use your features properly. I've already contacted support a week or 3 ago, but still haven't heard an update or solution to this issue🤷🏽‍♂"
2677,"- Couldn't add a bank account - non intuitive interface with no information on what it means ""which device"". Asked support for help and haven't heard back in 2 weeks. - App non responsive on first time use when data sync happens"
2678,I think its a great ide. But its qay not accurate. I try to refresh it and its been 8 days since the last update shows the wrong balances and purchases. Like i said would be great but doesnt work. Going online to your bank and seeing what you have done is easier. Uninstalling after having it for a month.
2679,I have been using this app for a couple of years and love it but due to recent updates it will no longer work on my tablet. I have contacted support and received no answers as to why tablets were removed. I still use the app but unfortunatly I have to use an android emulator on my pc to use it. If tablet support comes back I will gladly change my review because it has the potetial to be the best couples money managing app. Update still has not been resolved.
2680,Doesn't work
2681,Junk
2682,"Buggy. I have tried to make three separate actions on this app 1. Add my bank account. 2. Add line item budgeting 3. Contact customer service. All three have had different bugs from closing the out to app entirely to telling me the action won't work to try again later. Will be uninstalling. Chances are if you need this app, you're financially stressed and the bug issues absolutely do not help. I never got to experience what this app does bc I can't even get past the set up without issues."
2683,"You can't do anything at all unless you give the app your bank account details. No budgeting, no transaction entry, nothing."
2684,"This is a great app for organizing various accounts with your partner. However, a major drawback is the ads/articles posted under the 'Activity' tab. Under that tab I should be able to quickly see a summary of all activity on all linked accounts. But no, I have to sift through these unrelated ads/articles to find my activity. It's usually nestled in between the articles or all the way at the bottom. As far as I can tell, there are no settings to change this. Considering different apps bc of this"
2685,"Not accommodating to anything you would seek an app like this for in the first place! Joint function is a gimmick, nothing else works. My CC accounts always somehow fail to ""respond"" in order to sync. And it supports Chime Checking/Savings, but gives zero acknowledgement of the credit builder account they offer alongside those, which is mainly intended to be used in place of checking, and is amazing. So neither me or my SO can use this since it doesn't give us accurate/relevant figures at all."
2686,"The CIBC integration keeps on failing. I have found that opening the CIBC on my phone helps but sometimes it still fails to sync for a few days. I have e-mailed support on this and have not received a response. While I enjoy the app, if it does not sync it is pretty useless."
2687,The problem is the app is designed for you to use your bank account but what if you do not have one. Why can't you upload a fictitious account with the number you want and then use the budget based on that.
2688,Your forced to attach your bank account to the app.... ANYTHING could happen.
2689,"This is the worst banking app you can get imo. We got this app because we assumed it would be good as a way to organize our finances between the two of us. Over the last year or so, it has essentially become an advertisement for their own visa. Also, the metrics are absolutely bare bones."
2690,Me and my husband opened an joint account On here and now we can't seem to be able to close the account. and the support is not been any help what so ever. We did get our cards but can't now close the account please help.
2691,"OK, this app does not in any form allow for a budget. Unless I am missing something. The UI is way to complicated. You cant seem to do anything without syncing your cards and checking account. It should be called a money tracker, not a budget planner. A budget is created for different categories. Then each item adjusted for each category as money is removed. Not helpful, unless you have zero experience with book keeping."
2692,"Worked great at first. All the sudden it stopped working on my phone. Pixel 3 Android v11. First it stopped updating my bank account because of two factor on my bank. I got it connected back up, then it stopped showing transactions for my bank. Then it started crashing wherever I updated the transaction description on my wife's account. Uninstalled and reinstalled now it crashes everytime. Really like this app compared to others, if they can get it working right."
2693,"No Support or Customer Service. Have tried to link my accounts multiple times but the app was unsuccessful. When I tried to contact them through the app or email, my messages didn't get replies even after a week. Unless I enter my accounts manually, I'll have to look elsewhere for a working app."
2694,"Wanted to use this app and set it up with my husband with very high expectations, although I am about to remove it because I cannot talk with anybody customer service."
2695,Not consistent in behavior. Doesn't connect to a popular bank and an investment firm.
2696,Works to show all your bank information with your spouse! BUT it never updates when you do any new transactions or get a deposit or anything! Don't install this!!
2697,"Haven't been able to connect my accounts for months. Robinhood and vanguard haven't been able to connect for months. I reached out to support multiple times since March and received the same exact response everytime. ""This issue is affecting many users, we will reach out with an update"". Useless. And it's frustrating not being able to connect"
2698,None of the accounts linked are updating balances or even showing transactions. This isn't doing anything for anyone.
2699,"I live in Israel. Downloaded it just fine. Installed it just fine. My wife's phone is in Hebrew: ""Doesnt work in your country."" You are not worth the effort."
2700,"Can't get past the email verification. When I enter my email, when I click the email link, it sends me to the Play Store app page, and when I open the app it has me restart the process all over again. Terrible so far, please help!!"
2701,"It only works if you don't mind sharing your personal banking information, and won't even let you create a budget without that. Uninstalling now...."
2702,Can't link my bank accounts. Put your self together guys. Users are giving you a chance and you're failing
2703,"Major issues for me personally. I've had no luck linking my bank and the app. The app gets confused and asks for information prematurely. Information you could only see if your accounts are successfully linked. It's difficult to explain...which is probably why I have been ghosted by customer service for the last few days. Last I heard the engineering team was looking to fix the issue? Who knows? Seems to me this app just wasn't ready to be released, and has been playing ""catch up"" ever since."
2704,I tried to get the security pin a couple of times via email but I'm not receiving any. Please help
2705,Hubby hated it
2706,This is the worst! So not user friendly. Extremely confusing.
2707,This was extremely anticlimactic. You had me going in the first half. I have no idea how to add my partner because i got ahead of myself. You did not explain it.
2708,OK was really excited for my wife and I to try this....couldnt not get passed the adding my name portion. App timed out 4 times.
2709,"So the app itself is not terrible, I wish more to inform everyone to stay away from the banking option they have rolled out. I've tried using it one time so far via sending some money with my direct deposit, unfortunately I cannot tell you anything past that point due to the horrendous and awful service. The money did not show up so I called customer service just to be rum around because the information to verify my account, which I was reading from the app, was incorrect. I do not recommend."
2710,Couldn't even connect to my partner after trying everything I could think of and the company suggestions Cant even change who you sent the partner invite to even though it says cancel Do not download
2711,Doesn't work at all!
2712,Will not sync my bank accounts
2713,Unusable. Wont connect to either of my 2 bank accounts despite logging in and entering the OTP.
2714,"Seems like a great idea but fails to connect to any of the institutions listed, seems to be more of a data gatherer than anything. Shouldn't be release as it's obviously not ready to go live, chack out the other negative reviews to see the same issues again and again: won't connect to banks, loses all listed entries, fails to notify set dates etc etc"
2715,I installed it but it did not let me sign up. Kept saying my email was expired. So had to Uninstall it.
2716,Couldn't Get The Code To Go In To Sign. To App.
2717,PC Financial is unavailable
2718,"It looks promising but unfortunately it continually said ""there is a problem connecting to the internet"" and both for me and my girlfriend it was saying this as well as that we did not pass the security check to connect our bank. I can't give any further opinion on this app since I didn't make it past this point and could not manually enter information. I think I'll stick with the more simple yet more effective budget calender app."
2719,Chat experience blows. Sad.
2720,"Everytime I open this app, it refreshes the data and I have to re-enter all of my information, re-enter my bills, re-invite my husband. It is the most annoying thing ever. Not worth the hassle, unless it gets fixed, then it's totally worth it"
2721,They are still getting money from my bank even though I've deactivated my account. I need them to CUT IT OUT. I allowed them to take out 2.14 a month to use the service but I'M NOT USING IT ANYMORE. STOP TAKING MY MONEY.
2722,Lousy and useless. Worked for one day for both of us. Hasn't updated a single account since the day we installed it and added our bank/credit accounts (nearly two weeks ago). Completely left us in the lurch thinking we had more money in our checking accounts than we actually did. No one has even written me back about said issue. Entirely frustrating 😡
2723,I can receive notifications but I can't open the app on my phone. It always stops working when I try to load it.
2724,Tried it. Amounts are way off. Makes this app difficult to use. Sorry guys for me its a no from me.
2725,Really wanted to use this but the connector gets stuck on every bank I try
2726,Can't even add my bank gets stuck on redirecting to plaid
2727,"POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT, DO NOT USE! I was unable to link my bank (Monzo), emailed support and havent heard anything back. Given up now, would not recommend. Recent update: I have heard from the support team, told me they would look into for me, said to give them a day or two, however this update is posted a week later, still with no response and still unable to use the app thanks to being unable to link my Monzo bank account. The app is now uninstalled."
2728,Difficult to setup
2729,"Forget technical support I've tried for going on two months to contact someone so they could fix in are within the app and still nothing. If I could issue them 1/2 * I would. What a disappointment on a potentially user-friendly couples / budget app. And as far as asking for donations all the time, I wouldn't give you guys a pot to piss in."
2730,Won't load big name accounts keeps tell me I have the wrong username and passwords.
2731,Seems like good app but I wouldn't know if it worked since I can't add amounts... $$
2732,"Can't believe this is an ""Editors Choice""!!! My checking only showed spending, not deposits. Thought it might be my bank. Could not find any way to manually enter my deposits (checking or cash), or cash spending. I emailed support, and have waited over a week without a response. The app is worthless, and I can't believe I trusted them with my banking information."
2733,Poor app
2734,"Not really a budgeting app, more of a spending tracker. I connected my bank accounts and they wont update throughout the day, so you cant track your real time spensing. Contacted support about it and no response."
2735,"After over 40 years working I the tech industry, I build my first computer in 1975, I spent 2 hours trying to get my app to sync with my wife and not only did it not work we ended up upset with each other because she insisted this was the best app based on reviews. If it is they are smarter then me."
2736,I dont want ti have to create an account to use a bill pay reminder.
2737,would not connect to my bank account. I tried multiple times
2738,"Unusable. It keeps switching to the activity page no matter how many times I tapped on the budget page. I can't work on the budget page at all, so what's the point of this app then?"
2739,this app sucks. can't connect to bank.
2740,"I couldn't connect any of my bank accounts. And every time I switched apps to look up my passwords to fill in my login credentials the honey screen would add another set of username/password boxes, so I had 8 boxes after a few app switches; seems like there are a lot of bugs."
2741,Have to make an account.
2742,I wanted to use this app to budget but once I downloaded it and put my bank info in I had 2 emails within 2 days saying someone was trying to get into one of my accounts. I emailed customer service and received no response
2743,"sign up. get a warning about a credit application on my credit report the next day. coincidence? maybe, but I personally don't trust it any more."
2744,"account not syncing, work the first time you sync but not after that"
2745,"Broken, can't even sign up. Keeps saying ""Oops: Duplicate"""
2746,app gets stuck in an endless loop between uploading a photo and writting my name. Even after confirming my email it is still stuck in this loop. However during this time i was stuck in this stupid app I did not spend any money so it did work. Since writting this me and my girlfriend became so mad at the app we engaged in domestic voilence and are now breaking up. This will also help us save money since we'll be in jail. Thanks Honeydue!
2747,"The app won't allow us to add our bank account and manually adding in all our expenses just seems painful and a waste of time. Too bad we didn't even get to try this app out, it looked promising."
2748,"this app was perfect until until it crashed today. I tried to open the app multiple times all day and it wouldn't allow me, it just wouldn't open kept crashing. I then contacted the customer service via email and they said they would look into it. But nothing has changed . If they fix this I'll change it to 5 star because i did enjoy using this app alot."
2749,"Great concept if it worked. Out of the 4 major banks, it connects to one consistently."
2750,won't connect to my bank of America accounts. i have to uninstall
2751,Does not work offline. Why do u need 2 make an account 2 manage ur credit cards? Looking 4 something that works without an internet connection.
2752,deleted the app opted to tip $0 still charged me $2.11 are you kidding me?
2753,WARNING: We tried this app. A day later someone tried to get into our bank account. not sure if its connected or not. did take the chance and deleted it. It also was inaccurate to our bank account. User beware.
2754,"This is a joke. There's no actual usable webpage, only the app so adding accounts is maddening. Banks where I have accounts and credit cards only show credit cards. Can't add your partner if they already have an account, can only invite them as a new user. Everything seems very poorly executed beneath the pretentious skin."
2755,works only with connected bank accounts
2756,"Stupid app - every screen is just a prompt to connect a bank account. I just want to see when my bills are due and keep track of them, not share my financial information."
2757,Doed prepaid checking link ?
2758,"I want to test the app, without an account, that is unfortunately unavailable in this app. So bad, that you want my email and account creation, for a simple test."
2759,before I could check the app out it demanded a tip for each month. I had to enter a $ amount before I could go on. Deleated it immediately. Do not recomend it unless you have a lot of cash up to $10.00 each month.
2760,horrible app glitches all the time. I spent half an hour trying to change a single transaction to the right category and it wouldn't update. finally uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now its asking for the 6 digit code it texted to me I put it in 5 times triple checked it was correct kept saying correct tried responding the code 4 times before just saying forget it and deleting the app. Great idea I just wish it actually worked.
2761,why are my girlfriend's transactions still in the pending section? its been weeks now
2762,"Only supports US, Canadian dollars, pounds and euros, so it's of no use if you live in another country."
2763,wont even download for me
2764,"horrible, so many signin issues, recover password again? ridiculous. have attempted to use this program 3 times in last year. never convenient. update: while i was contacted by honeydue, and signin problem solved, the app still will not update with accounts. has not updated since first day"
2765,have to log a bank account
2766,to buggy
2767,"1/31/19 - installed app and tried to register as a new user. got past the email verification but app would not advance past the photo upload page. pressing Next or skip for later would return to the ""what should we call you"" page. entering name goes back to photo page. tried deleting and reinstalling 3x. same issue. App appears to have potential if users could actually get to content"
2768,Crashes on load. I can easily use the desktop version. But the app crashes every time I try to load it. Completely useless.
2769,Cant even login. I hit the login button and nothing happens.
2770,"Nice app, but since last update it no longer works"
2771,I got a new phone and app does not work. It doesn't let me sign in.
2772,It was working great until recently it opens as a blank white screen. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still doesn't work. Please fix!
2773,Worked fine until all the updates now it opens then kicks back to the loading screen and i can't do anything.
2774,Unfortunately I cannot use this app because it closes my keyboard as soon as it opens for the email and password login
2775,"I really, really wanted to love this app. My husband and I have been using it for a few months, and it has all the features I wanted. Sadly, it has never quite worked right. There have been too many bugs to count, but the main issue has been the slow synch with the linked bank accounts. It sometimes took several days for account balances update and transactions to show up. Then my budgets disappeared (twice it happened now), and now the app won't open at all after attempting to reinstall."
2776,"So disappointed with this app. It is not easy to use, the load time is horrendous, sometimes it wouldn't load the page you want at all. Such potential but the UX is garbage and the UI needs lots of improvement. Not intuitive enough."
2777,Loved this app on my Samsung s9. I just tried to download it on my note 10 and it won't load! All my info for taxes is on this app!!!! I'm really screwed now. I honestly don't know what I'm going to tell my tax preparer come January. I really hope they fix it! I have to track income/ outgo for out small business and I can't start the year over.
2778,This app has too many bugs. I tried to add new categories and they never show up in the list. The app is displaying some of my transactions from my linked bank account two times in a row when it only occurred once. I guess I'm back to the app store to find an app that actually works.
2779,"The app keep crashing every time I open it. Uninstalled and reinstalled, did not fix the issue."
2780,Seriously it unlinked my account twice. I can't use numbers for a code for two of my other accounts. It freezing up when I relink my main account.
2781,I have a Galaxy S7. It keeps crashing. Help!
2782,Edit: Will keep the rating as is until I can properly add my Capital One account. Either move away from Plaid as a data aggregation partner or just wait until they figure their own stuff out.
2783,It still won't launch in my Pixel 3a.
2784,The App. Is Freezing Up

2800,I have a Galaxy S7. It keeps crashing. Help!
2801,This app has too many bugs. I tried to add new categories and they never show up in the list. The app is displaying some of my transactions from my linked bank account two times in a row when it only occurred once. I guess I'm back to the app store to find an app that actually works.
2802,"Ive used this app for years now. Its just become more frustrating than anything else. The app no longer keeps upto date totals of envelopes properly. For example, I will enter a $10 transaction and the envelope, which had $50 in it, will continue to say $50 even though in the list of transactions in now says $40. This also affects the total displayed for a class of envelopes. Obviously this is frustrating as I will sometimes think I have more money allocated than I actually do. Changing apps."
2803,"Terrible, unusable app. App constantly crashes, doesn't sync with server, a whole consortium of other glitches. I spent an hour setting it up... will be uninstalling. This app clearly hasn't been properly tested. Also, 'filling' envelopes is not needed, it is confusing. Think it would be better (and simpler) if the app only tracked income vs categorized expenses."
2804,"I used this app for 1year and really enjoyed it. However it suddenly stopped syncing between my phones and web app. I tried everything including reinstall with no luck, it just keep getting stuck on endless spinning icon without syncing. This is a really bad"
2805,I would like a refund. This app will not sync and I cannot make any changes or actually use as a budget app because of this! Please cancel my subscription and issue a refund!!!!!
2806,"Unable to add envelopes in spite of paying additional fee. Difficult to find help for a particular question. Once payment is made there is no way to get refund. Yes, within 10 minutes of subscribing."
2807,"Doesn't auto fill envelopes with the amou t I set it to. It just says ""hm having trouble syncing to server"". Broken app. Can't believe I get used to using it for one month and then I found out at first envelope fill date it doesn't work"
2808,Paid for subscription. Sync doesn't work. App keeps saying to try again later. Few days later ... still not synching. Wrote to support as a PAID SUBSCRIBER. No answer. Don't pay for this app. I want my money back. App does NOT work and neither does support.
2809,"Put on some clown make up because the ""help"" button is a joke. It just touts their premium version of the app when I tried to get help because it is not a very intuitive app and I was willing to learn. But you just want me to pay premium if I want any help."
2810,very sad that the free version only off 20 spaces total. makes it difficult for anyone trying to break down a whole budget to reduce spending overall :(
2811,If I could rate this zero I would. After crunching my numbers and setting it all up it never sync up info from my end and eventually crashed loosing everything. Worst app I have ever used.
2812,Many better options available at much cheaper rates..
2813,Only online. No offline options. Sync issues. Outdated UI. Many features missing.
2814,I'm still waiting for my refund even after mailing them 3 times!!
2815,Too complicated. Too many issues trying to edit envelopes. Some envelopes not filling up.
2816,Only one account can be created in Free mode. Well that ain't satisfaying at all to encourage for a premium. Uninstalled in 2 min.
2817,"I didn't even get to try it, only gives you 10 spots for your items. I need a detailed budget"
2818,Doesn't seem to do much ori just don't know how to use it and really it's not telling me home except to make envelopes for what purpose? I know what i spend. Just the list doesn't mean anything for me.
2819,Do not like interface or how the system is set up - not very user friendly
2820,"Plain simple, non competitive and surely lacking"
2821,"That's really very hard to understand and work with together, wst of the time."
2822,Unable to sync across devices
2823,"Pointless. If it doesn't sync with your bank account, what's the point?"
2824,Way to glitchy. Not user friendly.
2825,All of my information was erased because I didn't make an account. Now my budget has to start from the beginning.
2826,Really crappy to me.. much better apps out there that do much more
2827,Not enough features to really help budget
2828,Monthly/ yearly subscription what a joke
2829,Sync doesn't work for over 4hrs now
2830,Only gives you 10 items so no good for me
2831,Need to setup an account just to use this
2832,hard to setting
2833,Difficult to use
2834,Not user friendly
2835,I am confuse ...uninstall
2836,No instructions?
2837,Have used this for years happily. But the latest update broke the app in a subtle and very disruptive way. Downgrading to 1 star. Very disappointed. Am a longstanding customer.
2838,"App itself looks nice, but there is 0 information on how to use it at the beginning and at the e-mail & password screen there is a back button but app doesn't alow me to go back. Ever. Even if I killed the app I can't restart. Which is very disturbing."
2839,No matter what I tried it kept telling me I had negative balances when I had spent LESS than my budget. How is that possible? Would never recommend! Do not use this app!
2840,"Good customer service, bad programing. I guess it's really made for the web app. I started with the phone app, and tried to schedule an envelope fill. Well, it has to sync to do that, which mine will not do. I registered my household and everything. Troubleshooting the problem did not work, and so support told me I would have to manually transfer my data to the web app. I'm 3 months in, no way am I doing that. I'd sooner transfer the info to another app, or maybe just go back to pen and paper. On this app, using my phone, there's no way to schedule an envelope fill, but much worse than that I can't delete a scheduled envelope fill either. It's just always going to be there with an error message."
2841,Horrible. It rolls over any leftover money you have into the next month and there is NO WAY to undo this setting. It encourages you to empty every envelop rather than save your money.
2842,"I wrote a glowing review of this app a while ago. I'm changing the rating from 5 stars to 1 because I just discovered a fatal flaw with the program: Sometimes it will not save transaction information after you click the Save button. I have tested this multiple times on several devices and browsers, and the error repeats itself across them all. At the very least, this means you have to double-check every single transaction you add, since the error seems to be random. Unfortunately I discovered this error way too late to reconstruct the history of my accounts, which is a devastating loss of information. Obviously I strongly advise anyone against using this app. You can't trust it."
2843,"I'm not able to sync the latest transaction in the app. It's been 4 days 
since the issue."
2844,"It says you can link a bank account. You can't. You can manually put in 
dollar amounts for ""accounts"". It says 2 free accounts, when trying to add 
a second it says ""you've reached your limit"" . Absolute garbage app. Can't 
use it at all how it's advertised."
2845,"Good for personal budgeting. The envelop system is brilliant! I wonder why 
other similar apps lack this feature?"
2846,"This app does not have the option for bi-monthly accounting filling (15th and 30th), and it is extremely annoying.  Also, the fact that you can't have the same frequency for budget envelopes as with expenses."
2847,Too hard to break things up the way i want
2848,Crashing on my galaxy s7 edge
2849,I believe in privacy! And every app is about knowing you!
2850,Too complicated
2851,No
2852,Hruuuza
2853,Only one account on free version so unable to sufficiently assess app's capabilities. Waste of time.  Uninstalled.
2854,"Pointless if you spend monthly on more than 10 things, yes a mere 10. Ironically you'll have to make an envelope for this app, as you must pay nearly £5 a month to list more! Uninstalled."
2855,"Can't connect, can't create an account... Boo!"
2856,Couldn't  use it...didn't understand the way it worked
2857,"$45 a year just for an app? Are you guys in comedy? The app is NOT free. Only ONE acct, INCLUDING CASH, renders it useless. Only 10 envelopes for free. Searching for alternative."
2858,"This occurs when first setting everything up. I can't fill them individually. Crashes. Only way past the app is by letting the app fill everything for me. Great for people who fit this ""fill em up for me"" situation. Sucks for my specific use case apparently."
2859,"Have you never heard of anyone getting paid every FOUR Weeks!! A lot of people do including me but you have Weekly pay and two Weekly but no four Weekly, how hard would it have been to include four Weekly guys, apart from that it seems pretty good but I can't use it."
2860,app crushes. plz add a tutorial on how to work around.
2861,App kept on forcing me to pay for upgrade and would not allow me to use app.
2862,Crappy app does not allow for biweekly and monthly expenses at same time and kept crashing
2863,The layout of the interface is boring and not structured like a budget should be.
2864,"Hey, I don't mind ads. Please add an option to have unlimited envelopes."
2865,This thing is confusing as all hell.
2866,Why Do I have to create an account ??!
2867,Don't like to log on. Just want to use the app. Don't need all this extra waste of time.
2868,Not automated enough
2869,Limited to 10 monthly items
2870,Only allows you to have 10 monthly bills.
2871,Complicated
2872,pretty much useless cant edit or update anything properly makes incorrect calculations on account dispite input being correct. have to inconveniently log into the site to do anthing effectively. the list goes on
2873,"I used to be a paid subscriber, but getting frustrated with bugs and lack of updates."
2874,Great idea. Not user friendly. Unable to reset budget without making it look like you spent a shiz load of money.
2875,"Not user friendly. Would be easier to setup reoccurring income and expenses like rent, cable, etc. Couldn't even setup the income so uninstall."
2876,"This is my third try with this app. It crashed several times before I finished doing the initial setup, and I still can't figure out how to set an initial balance for my account (or to edit the account in any way, for that matter). Edit: apparently you have to do that on the web or an iPhone; so android app seems pretty limited. The idea seems to be really good, which made me keep trying to get it working, but it just didn't work out for me."
2877,"This an abandoned product in an awful state. Very basic, full of bugs, avoid. Ie if enter an expense while offline the transaction is not saved when data connection is restored. Not even a very basic income and expense report included. Moving buttons to top was a bad choice, most people have their hands at bottom. Dev recommended to swipe, however swipe requires even more hand movement and is only available for switching between tabs, i.e. not for new transaction. Controls should be optimized so that the least hand movement is required to reach them."
2878,"Tried this app again on a new Samsung tablet. I can get a bit farther into the app now, but it still crashes a lot and is unusable.  Also, it bugs you at every turn to sign up for an account on their website."
2879,I only spent five minutes on this app because it only allows 1 account in the initial free setup.  I would prefer a short term trial to see if the app performs to my needs and expectations before investing money in it.
2880,"Not functional for budgeting. Asks you to setup your expenses as envelopes & what your monthly budget for each one is. You fill in your weekly income and it calculates your monthly income but then it does nothing with this figure. You must still manually fill each envelope but you can't do it from your monthly calculated wage, the filling must come from ""credits""  you must manually enter. It asks for saving goals but treats them as expenses still and puts you ""into the red"" if you save towards your goal."
2881,Why does every app wants people to create an account on their server? So they can store all my spending records /data?
2882,"I don't like it bc it refuses to fix my budget amount,  it always reverts back to the one they started me with :("
2883,Very difficult and could not understand.
2884,There is no reason I should need to give my email I just want to make my own list and have it do the math
2885,Not user friendly. Counter intuitive.
2886,Limited use for free users
2887,Forced to make a 5star comment....
2888,Not for me
2889,Wants money
2890,So confused
2891,"This was a good app until I decided to reconcile.  Apparently it doesnèt know how to add and subtract.  Even after finding variance and making the adjustment, it still did not show the right bank balance.  Not sure what I will do now other than be very disapppointed that I finally found an app that was suppose to help me accomplish the envelope system the way that it promised.  I have spent more that 8 hours on this app between set -up and reconciliation, and I only used it for 3 weeks.  By the way, I have an Accountant background and was once a QuickBooks Advisor and trainer, so I know what I am doing."
2892,"This app is very user-unfriendly. It's extremely difficult and confusing to use. Even for me, and I grew up in the generation that grew up with technology! If anyone should understand how to use it, it's me... I suggest a complete overhaul of the app design because it's absolutely horrible."
2893,"Functionality suffers from another poor Google material design update. I click ""fill envelopes"" and select ""fill each envelope"" and all my envelopes are 0.00$. So, I try again and again. Now my bank account shows some 6k and my envelopes are still 0."
2894,Is there any way I can delete all the transactions and start freshly again?
2895,I would be happy to pay more for unlimited envelopes if I could use Google play credit. Otherwise great app. Love the new look too!
2896,"I thought this was going to be a great app until I started entering our bills and half way through it wouldn't let me add any more because the limit had been reached, if I didn't have a lot of bill I wouldn't need an app...hello!"
2897,"The app will not let me complete the setup for a household. It will not accept my email and refuses to let me exit that screen of the setup. I am also unable to exit the app, I have to restart my phone to get out of it."
2898,You can only trial it fully if you only have a few expenses. If you want to add more you have to buy it. But I'm not going to buy it unless I can fully trial it. so it's a ridiculous limitation and I have to go to the next app.
2899,Only allows you to have 10 envelopes. Any more and it'll cost you 50 bucks a year! What a rip off
2900,It keeps on crashing. Interface is not so user friendly. Sorry guys! But keep on improving. I'll check it back.
2901,"Only lets me input 10 monthly  envelopes, I have way more then 10. Didnt work out for me."
2902,"That's really very hard to understand and work with together, wst of the time."
2903,I'm still waiting for my refund even after mailing them 3 times!!
2904,Many better options available at much cheaper rates..
2905,I would like a refund. This app will not sync and I cannot make any changes or actually use as a budget app because of this! Please cancel my subscription and issue a refund!!!!!
2906,"Pointless. If it doesn't sync with your bank account, what's the point?"
2907,Sync doesn't work for over 4hrs now
2908,No toycu
2909,Not user friendly
2910,"Doesn't auto fill envelopes with the amou t I set it to. It just says ""hm having trouble syncing to server"". Broken app. Can't believe I get used to using it for one month and then I found out at first envelope fill date it doesn't work"
2911,Doesn't seem to do much ori just don't know how to use it and really it's not telling me home except to make envelopes for what purpose? I know what i spend. Just the list doesn't mean anything for me.

2930,"Terrible, unusable app. App constantly crashes, doesn't sync with server, a whole consortium of other glitches. I spent an hour setting it up... will be uninstalling. This app clearly hasn't been properly tested. Also, 'filling' envelopes is not needed, it is confusing. Think it would be better (and simpler) if the app only tracked income vs categorized expenses."
2931,very sad that the free version only off 20 spaces total. makes it difficult for anyone trying to break down a whole budget to reduce spending overall :(
2932,Have used this for years happily. But the latest update broke the app in a subtle and very disruptive way. Downgrading to 1 star. Very disappointed. Am a longstanding customer.
2933,Too complicated. Too many issues trying to edit envelopes. Some envelopes not filling up.

2936,Only one account can be created in Free mode. Well that ain't satisfaying at all to encourage for a premium. Uninstalled in 2 min.
2937,"Ive used this app for years now. Its just become more frustrating than anything else. The app no longer keeps upto date totals of envelopes properly. For example, I will enter a $10 transaction and the envelope, which had $50 in it, will continue to say $50 even though in the list of transactions in now says $40. This also affects the total displayed for a class of envelopes. Obviously this is frustrating as I will sometimes think I have more money allocated than I actually do. Changing apps."
2938,"Unable to add envelopes in spite of paying additional fee. Difficult to find help for a particular question. Once payment is made there is no way to get refund. Yes, within 10 minutes of subscribing."
2939,Not enough features to really help budget
2940,Paid for subscription. Sync doesn't work. App keeps saying to try again later. Few days later ... still not synching. Wrote to support as a PAID SUBSCRIBER. No answer. Don't pay for this app. I want my money back. App does NOT work and neither does support.
2941,Monthly/ yearly subscription what a joke
2942,"App itself looks nice, but there is 0 information on how to use it at the beginning and at the e-mail & password screen there is a back button but app doesn't alow me to go back. Ever. Even if I killed the app I can't restart. Which is very disturbing."

DO NOT UPGRADE TO PRO AND DO NOT BOTHER TO UPGRADE, WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY. NO SUPPORT AT ALL. IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY BUG, JUST BE READY TO FIX YOURSELF OR JUST WAIT FOR MONTHS OR YEARS TO GET IT FIXED. NORTH WORHT IT."
3004,"Used this app for years, was great. Now they are forcing premium subscription, I don't want to have to pay for what I was doing for free for years. Well now I need to find another app that does it just as well as dollarbird without the paid subscription"
3005,"EXTREMELY disappointed in their new limits! I've been using DB for YEARS to keep my budget in check and recommend it to everyone. Suddenly, and without warning, they've changed their free model so that users are limited to an unreasonable 3 transactions a day unless you want to pay $10/mo. They don't even offer a lifetime option. How is an app that's supposed to help me control my spending going to start asking me for money? Very, very disappointed in y'all, Dollarbird. I'll be switching apps!"
3006,"DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP! I was using this while it was free and for the most part I was happy with it. Every once in a while there would be a glitch in my balance from an expense not getting added, or it would be double, or income would be doubled. I got back on to update accounts and now you have to PAY to be able to do the bare minimum! TRASH!"
3007,"Amazing and simple app until they started limiting daily entries. I would have been happy to do a once off purchase to unlock the ability to add more entries, but definitely not worth ~$60AUD a year. It's a simple (and sometimes buggy) app, you're better off spending your money on a more fully fledged alternative that has a once off payment of <$10AUD for premium."
3008,"This app used to be perfect for an easy way to balance my checking account and manually entering my bills and spending in a nice calendar format. This new subscription system is rediculous, I don't need multiple calenders or users. There should be a one time charge for a single user vs a subscription for multiple users and cloud connectivity."
3009,"I wasn't happy to the limits imposed but since I really need this app I paid for the yearly plan. However, the app is not working correctly, it constantly shows no internet connection not being able to enter new data. This affects the efficiency of the app and the main reason of why I need it. Please fix this."
3010,"I have been using dollar bird to organize my finances for YEARS and have recommended it to plenty of people in that time, alot of whom have opted for the paid version. Now I'm limited to 3 transactions per day? All because it doesn't seem cost effective for me to pay for more than one calender and user since that's all I need? I get you need to be competitive but why nerf the free version to the point where it's hardly usable?"
3011,It was a nice app until they started to limit your daily entries. I was using it to show a projected financial outlook after a few weeks. Now they have decided to limit free users daily entries. I'm not paying $9 a month to have 20 users and 3 calendars. I only need one. Very disappointed.
3012,The update is awful. Nothing syncs anymore. And there is a new limit on adding transactions. Bring back the old version that actually worked.
3013,"It was all perfect, until today, you require me to subscribe to keep adding transactions because I reached the maximum daily amount, but I added only 3. You should say that when the app is being installed, not now that I have a couple months of data 🙄"
3014,"Daily user for years. Suddenly, they add limited transactions per day. Now it's useless for me. Not recommend for now."
3015,Been using it for a while now but very disappointed with DB as there are limits no for daily transaction. I've told my friends that this app is really helpful but with this new update I'm really disappointed. Looks like I'm gonna search for a new app. Thanks DB for your service.
3016,This was an amazing app! Key word being was. As of this week they decided to limit entry of transactions to just three per day without having a paid subscription. What an absolute joke!
3017,I didn't like the sudden pay wall that just appeared without notice. Completely disrupted the daily use which stopped me from using it. Will not be recommending anymore.
3018,This app was fantastic. Now they started to charge to insert your transactions. How can you do it again without charge?
3019,"The developers of this app are absolute morons and have no understanding of how to win over their customers. I've been a user for over 5 years approximately and, like a lot of the other reviewers, have been a huge advocate for this app. I've been such an advocate of this app that all my ex-girlfriends use it. Now that they have severely limited the capabilities of the app and have gone to a subscription service I no longer advocate for it and I see their ratings and fan base is dropping."
3020,"New update has put limit on daily transactions, and forces you to subscribe, which is a big disappointment ..."
3021,Paid for the app and money has been deducted but it's not offering me the premium version and keeps glitching. So disappointed
3022,"I've used this app for years, and recommended it to everyone. Now with the limits in place, I'll find a new app."
3023,You seriously think I'm going to pay a subscription to be able to add more than three payments a day?
3024,"I LOVED this app....until I had to reinstall and now I not only lost all my transactions, but cannot add anything or do anything in the app. The ""add"" button is missing and I keep getting a ""Something went wrong."" error message. I have not heard anything back from developers yet, though I've sent in two emails now. Please help!"
3025,"I've been using this app for a long time and let me tell you, it's only halfway done. I've been very patient but it hasn't been updated in a year and they dont respond to customer requests. The app is dead. Hopefully someone builds a new one."
3026,It stopped working have to continuously be refreshing for transactions to load. New transactions won't sync
3027,"Requires you to sign into their servers (I'll host my own financial information, not you) and they don't offer lifetime subscriptions ($40 per year and that doesn't even unlock everything?)."
3028,"Something Went Wrong. Was unable to update my expenses, uninstalled and reinstalled, tried logging in and it keeps saying (Something Went Wrong). Was not able to use from then on, please fix !!!!"
3029,Used to be an exceptional budgeting tool for households. Now unfortunately moving to a 'paid' model.
3030,Lots of potential. Can't use the invite option tho. Doesn't work. I'm disappointed!! I spent money on your app. Enjoy my $3 I guess.
3031,"Changed the app, takes forever to troubleshoot. I no longer reccomend it."
3032,Great concept. Easy to use interface. Unfortunately it changes the input values and is unusable.
3033,"The app is very good, but Data Export option removed which is very disappointing me for analysis hence now finding another app operation for the same."
3034,Continually finding that projected balance doesn't update correctly based on future transactions. Developer did not respond to support question. Not usable.
3035,Bad experience. I can not log in my new mobile. I tried to reset but It' s not working
3036,Not easy to use/not intuitive/unfriendly UI/hard to understand/
3037,"Use EasyBudget by Benoit instead. Dollar bird hasn't updated since 2018, doesn't properly add or subtract amounts, and is now panhandling for subscriptions?! Make a working app first!"
3038,Can't log in through mobile or web. Changing password doesn't work
3039,There is no reminder for up coming bills??? What's the point of a calendar with no reminders? Let me know when you add this.
3040,Used to be free
3041,worst app ever why you have limited the transactions !!!!!!!!
3042,App does not work
3043,"What wrong with you, think twice about your customers ."
3044,"After using this successfully for a few years it has recently become completely unusable. Transactions don't appear, random balances of minus 45k!!!! Crashing continually. Having relied on this for budgeting and knowing what is coming up it has somewhat left me in the dark. Uninstall and reinstall made no difference and this is the paid version!!!!!"
3045,"Edit: I haven't used this app in a while, but was very disappointed to see that I was limited further to what I could do. I used to be able to have one calendar and add as many transactions as possible. Now it limits me to 3. What a shame, I like this app too. Moving on to a different app now."
3046,Trash
3047,Has a bug. Entered an expense that repeats every month once and shows I spent twice as much for the current month.
3048,"Should have included database. My internet connection is stable but 50% of the time, the there is not connection or it takes a while to load. HGGGGGGNGH"
3049,"I absolutely loved the original Dollarbird, and I was really excited for the new app. I've had no trouble with the app up until today. I went to log in, and the app said that I had failed to authenticate my email address. I'm pretty sure I did do this when I switched to the new app, but with trying to have either the app or the website send me the verification email, I have not received any email before the email link expires. I really need this app to work!"
3050,The older version was bug free and worked really good. But this version does not update accurately and all previous records are wrong.
3051,"sorry for 1 star. But I have to switch back to classic one because of UX is worse. I get used to swipe down to add balance and then just do one click to choose my category. It's really really fast. But this new app makes me more step to add transaction. Second problem is about others already reviewed such as no offline/local storage, no widget, wrong migration."

3062,"Used this app for years, was great. Now they are forcing premium subscription, I don't want to have to pay for what I was doing for free for years. Well now I need to find another app that does it just as well as dollarbird without the paid subscription"

However, the app is not working correctly, it constantly shows no internet connection not being able to enter new data. This affects the efficiency of the app and the main reason of why I need it. Please fix this."
3068,"This app used to be perfect for an easy way to balance my checking account and manually entering my bills and spending in a nice calendar format. This new subscription system is rediculous, I don't need multiple calenders or users. There should be a one time charge for a single user vs a subscription for multiple users and cloud connectivity."
3069,Paid for the app and money has been deducted but it's not offering me the premium version and keeps glitching. So disappointed
3070,"DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP! I was using this while it was free and for the most part I was happy with it. Every once in a while there would be a glitch in my balance from an expense not getting added, or it would be double, or income would be doubled. I got back on to update accounts and now you have to PAY to be able to do the bare minimum! TRASH!"
3071,Been using it for a while now but very disappointed with DB as there are limits no for daily transaction. I've told my friends that this app is really helpful but with this new update I'm really disappointed. Looks like I'm gonna search for a new app. Thanks DB for your service.
3072,"EXTREMELY disappointed in their new limits! I've been using DB for YEARS to keep my budget in check and recommend it to everyone. Suddenly, and without warning, they've changed their free model so that users are limited to an unreasonable 3 transactions a day unless you want to pay $10/mo. They don't even offer a lifetime option. How is an app that's supposed to help me control my spending going to start asking me for money? Very, very disappointed in y'all, Dollarbird. I'll be switching apps!"

3076,"Amazing and simple app until they started limiting daily entries. I would have been happy to do a once off purchase to unlock the ability to add more entries, but definitely not worth ~$60AUD a year. It's a simple (and sometimes buggy) app, you're better off spending your money on a more fully fledged alternative that has a once off payment of <$10AUD for premium."
3077,"It was all perfect, until today, you require me to subscribe to keep adding transactions because I reached the maximum daily amount, but I added only 3. You should say that when the app is being installed, not now that I have a couple months of data 🙄"
3078,"I have been using dollar bird to organize my finances for YEARS and have recommended it to plenty of people in that time, alot of whom have opted for the paid version. Now I'm limited to 3 transactions per day? All because it doesn't seem cost effective for me to pay for more than one calender and user since that's all I need? I get you need to be competitive but why nerf the free version to the point where it's hardly usable?"
3079,It stopped working have to continuously be refreshing for transactions to load. New transactions won't sync
3080,This app was fantastic. Now they started to charge to insert your transactions. How can you do it again without charge?
3081,It was a nice app until they started to limit your daily entries. I was using it to show a projected financial outlook after a few weeks. Now they have decided to limit free users daily entries. I'm not paying $9 a month to have 20 users and 3 calendars. I only need one. Very disappointed.

3101,The older version was bug free and worked really good. But this version does not update accurately and all previous records are wrong.
3102,I pay for the premium service of this app but it simply doesn't work. As in literally does not pull in transactions correctly. I have been waiting for over a month for a response to a ticket and every time I reach out to development they just say they are working on it. Insane to pay for something that literally does not function. Would not recommend
3103,"This app has wonderful potential, but I too am experiencing an integration issue that has not been resolved. The workaround I've been provided is not an option as I'm not able to export transactions from my bank in the format required by Mvelopes. I've paid for the service and it's absolutely useless until this issue is resolved. Good luck speaking with anyone in support. My request for an update has gone unanswered and I've been waiting in a chat queue for over 3 hours to escalate."
3104,"Not off to a great start. I downloaded today after a friend raved about this app. It is super glitchy and will not let me edit my envelope funds. Also finding the answers online is extremely difficult but the help service isn't open on weekends. For a subscription app, it would sure be great if it was user friendly. Some of the buttons/options that are supposed to be there just aren't. And I don't have a computer so this app is my only way. Please fix these issues ASAP."
3105,"can even start. downloaded press open, all I get error try later."
3106,It's been almost a month now and I've heard nothing back from customer support about a fix to be able to add my bank account. I keep getting an error and ice tried several times to reach out but no one responds. It sucks to have paid for something that doesn't even work!
3107,"No way to cancel. ""I forgot username"" link takes you to a form demanding your username and email, huh? No phone number on web site. No way to contact them to cancel."
3108,Unexpected error while opening the all first time.. uninstalled the app
3109,"Don't waste your money. App never worked as advertised. Requested support to fix my sync issues for 6 weeks. They never managed to fix them. What a frustrating waste of time. App is buggy, support responses are slow not a good experience. Tried several other apps that all had no problems syncing with my banks. Used the app and website over a year ago and thought coming back would be an improvement but it's much worse."
3110,"Have been using this app for a couple years now and, for the most part, have really enjoyed it. Version 5 seems to have killed it though?? US Bank will no longer connect to the app - message keeps saying there is nothing that can be done, and that I should manually input my transactions from US Bank accounts....what?! On the hunt to find a replacement as we speak..."
3111,"Very basic app...not sure why the bank account connection is available since you have to manually fund envelopes, expenses. Expected much more from a paid app."
3112,"Would be a great app... If it worked. Despite paying for it, I can't log in, all it does is ask me to buy a plan... Even though I couldn't do so if I wanted since Google play prevents me from doing so again. Desktop, mobile browser, Apple devices, all ask me to pay despite me already paying. It was working for a few days. Now I've lost all the work I did setting it up. Update: every time I try to contact mvelopes they say I have to use live chat but every time I try, live chat is offline."
3113,I have been using this app since its early years in 2010. I used to love it but would not recommend it to other users now. It has not been able to connect to my bank for over two months and customer service has been completely unhelpful. They suggested that I manually import my transactions to the app instead but the app gives me an error message every time I try and customer service only sends generic canned responses to my requests for assistance. I am frustrated and tired of paying for an app that doesn't work.
3114,"Spent hours on the website & app trying to get them to work as intended. Mvelopes5 started the weekend I opened my account. I gave up after a few months. Might be worth it if they get the bugs worked out but take the free version for a month or 2. Once you pay canceling is a hassel with them. You have to email that you want to cancel, then you have to reply to an email received to explain why, then you need to follow up to confirm they cancelled THEN they cancel. Still charging as you wait."
3115,"7/6/2020 Can't even login anymore, because it tells me to upgrade to mvelopes 5. But i have the newest version available. It did this to me about 6 months ago too. This is old. 9/6/2020 Nothing has changed. I'm still unable to login with this app. Very frustrating when I'm paying mvelopes to use it. Makes me want to change to a different company to budget my money."
3116,"Zero stars. Absoltue trash. My Android app won't sync with the web app. Spent my whole lunch hour on chat just to end up being told to reinstall the app... guess what, it didn't fix anything. And there is no ""Version 5"" in the app store, so dont bother with your auto-reply. Terrible. Off to find another option. Won't be back. And will never recommend."
3117,"I have used this app for years. I loved it at first and was able to get my budget under control. Unfortunately, ""improvements and updates"" have caused it to no longer function properly. I no longer receive notices in my phone off new purchases. Many charges are recorded multiple times and I could never find a way to delete them. (Doesn't appear to be possible) Tech support was no help. I have tried to continue using it for over a year and finally had to change to a different budgeting app."
3118,"The app is horribly slow, doesn't connect to all banks and doesn't feel intuitive at all! As other reviewers have mentioned canceling from the ""Free Trial"" is a pain. The link to cancel via the web app displays an obviously built in message that they are having difficulty and to contact the live chat or send an email. Email does not provide an option for cancellation support and their live chat agents are completely useless as they say they have to send an email on my behalf to cancel. I wish I never attempted to try this app because now I am going to have to fight any charges attempted while I am working on confirming my cancellation which will take up my time. Even when I went to leave feedback after my chat session I got all the way to the last question (titled ""Question Fourth"") and upon hitting submit was met with an error page. I DO NOT TRUST THIS APP or the company behind it. It should be as easy to cancel as they make it to upgrade my subscription."
3119,"I have been using this budgeting tool for 10 years or more and have loved it and recommended it to others. But since they rolled out the update about a year ago, it has been very difficult to use, I have needed the assistance from customer service just to do basic things like sync accounts and now all my envelope balances are incorrect. I am a lifetime member so I hate to have to switch, but it has literally become unusable to me without starting over, so I guess this is goodbye..."
3120,I have used this service for over 2 years. Since the update and move to Mvelopes 5 I have been very unhappy. I cannot look at spending trends on the same page as my envelopes any more. You must manually figure your average spending vs funding... in the past you could do this on the inbox page. Whoever had the bright Ideal to change this was not so bright. Its also slow on pulling in transactions from Capital One. I would suggest finding another app. There are a lot out there that will work better than this. Mvelopes you should go back to the old set up and sue your web developer....
3121,"I had been a customer for 8 years. Originally the app and desktop web version were great. Performance has gone down hill with each update, to where it would regularly lose contact with banks and miss transactions. The most recent, it duplicated every account, after asking me to relogin to the bank, again... After three weeks of asking, and over 40 missing transactions, the best we got from customer service was to assign any duplicate money to an envelope and ignore it. No solution. We're done."
3122,Do not get this app! I canceled my subscription through the Play Store & they deleted my account- but my card is still getting billed $59.99/mo. I can't get ahold of support because I don't have an active account anymore and can no longer log in. I'm going to have to change my card number to prevent losing $720/year. DO NOT GET THIS APP. It's not worth it!!
3123,"This is a scam. I signed up for the 30 day free trial, but you can't actually use your account without fully committing to a subscription and paying them. You can't cancel your account during the 30 day free trial because you do not have access to the account settings that allow you to do that. There is no email contact info for this company anywhere, chat help does not exist. Huge waste of time and now I have to worry that they will charge my credit card without my permission. Good times. 👎"
3124,"Great app amazing and I absolutely love it 5+ stars when it works.... If this app were a car it would be the 2018 Ford Escape, engine blows up after 6k miles. It doesn't matter how good it is and how many features it has if it isn't reliable. My account will spontaneously not log in and not update my budget. The app will tell me to try again later, 2+ wks later I have to ask them to fix it manually. Keep changing my review from 5 stars for service to 1 star every time there is another problem"
3125,"Worst support for a paid service. Canceling my subscription has been a BATTLE since I can't remember my username - can't cancel from the app even if you're logged in (for some reason, even tho I signed up through the app, subs may only be cancelled through the web). Trying to get support to help me find my username has been a mess. I'm now in my 9th hour trying to get through to support. Ticketing system says I'm 54th in line - then 97th. Suddenly 1st, and I miss it for lunch. Just walk away."
3126,03-21-2019: Created an account via browser along with a trial subscription. Tried to login with app and my credentials weren't recognized. Had to sign up again and ended up with two separate accounts using identical credentials. There's no obvious way to delete your account either. Trying to get them deleted now so I'm not charged for a broken service. 09-17-2020: Mvelopes account still hasn't been deleted and I still can't get ahold of someone smart enough to delete it. Avoid this service like the plague it is!
3127,I heard about them through a financial class I took and was excited to use their app. The problem is I could never get my America First account connected. I contacted their support and they said there was an issue with the Mvelopes system. Over two weeks have gone by and its still not fixed. Not only that but they've ignored the last few emails I've sent asking for an update. Don't use if you have an America First account.
3128,"We had 1 account for many years & opened another account under a different email & bank account because we liked it. After about 9 months they just deleted our first main account & we were never notified. Never able to connect with anyone other than chat since there is no phone or email availability by mvelopes. Chatting kept telling us someone will call, never did. We left Feb 3 and found another budget system. All we got was an email stating ""sorry to see you go""...from a ""no reply"" email."
3129,"We really wanted to try Mvelopes, unfortunately I can only log in from the website, but the app says incorrect password every time I try to log in. Update: tried with a different email and it still doesn't sync from web accounts and app accounts. customer support wanted me to send them a ton of information to try to solve the problem. The entire point of wanting to try this app was for ease of use.. definitely not worth it. I will use a better supported app for my family."
3130,"Wouldn't let me create a password so I can't use it... It kept telling me to add special characters, which I did. It still wouldn't accept it Also, it really makes the app seem fishy when the terms of use check box is the same as the email list check box."
3131,"This app is horrible. Capital one transactions don't show up. Their web based app is flash promises to update are going on 2+ years. I fought for over an hour to get manual transactions entered in since their auto download from Capital One doesn't work. Their Chat support told me everything was operating fine, when obviously it wasn't."
3132,The app and website are totally broken. I can't log in to either and chat support no longer exists and email support won't respond. I pay for a service that I cannot even log into to cancel my account and export my data. Avoid this app and service or your data will be held hostage as well.
3133,"used to love it but it did something funny so I deleted it hoping to reinstall. Now, It won't even let me do that. Grr! *Spent some time with support team. They couldn't figure out the problem so they moved it to some other department. I was told they would email me when the problem is solved. That was weeks ago. No resolution."
3134,As of today (1/29/2019) the app is unusable. They apparently did a major upgrade to their webapp and now the Android app is broken. It really sucks because Ive enjoyed the service otherwise and its really helped my family get on a good track financially.   Get your change management under control Finicity! Why are you rolling out major version changes when you arent ready on all of your supported platforms? And before you tell me to upgrade to version 5 in your auto-reply...why dont you make sure its ready to go up on the store PRIOR to changing your backend?
3135,"Was ok a couple years ago but is horrible now. Bank balances don't update, customer service is now non-existent, and they won't let me into the phone app due to a change in subscriptions even though my annual subscription doesn't expire for 4 months!"
3136,"You can't actually do anything with the app unless you link it to a checking account and then you can only actually budget the cash balance in that account. The app shouldn't care where the money is coming from that's the easy part, where it is going is what the app is supposed to help identify!!"
3137,"I liked envelope budgeting... been using this app for 3 years... remains frustrating with many issues ... poor customers service..... and now we have to pay for that! Switching for better, hard to get worst! UPDATE 2020/06/18 NEVER AGAIN! They're don't care about customers..."
3138,1. No option for account transfers in app 2. Accounts balance doesn't update after inputting account transaction 3. Downloaded transactions show multiple copies of same transaction. No really ready for prime time. Not really usable.
3139,Poor user interface online. Was told the v5 app is not functioning correctly. iPhones rolled out in January. customer service gave me a direct download link for an apk file which didn't work. I'm not paying a monthly subscription for something that has an app not being fixed since January- 7 months later
3140,"Used to be great. Mvelopes 4 had to be migrated from flash... Did some manager decided to re-invent the app? MV5 doesn't have the same basic features (transfer between accounts, reconcile)... that should have been a given. Boy I am truly disappointed. I am looking for alternatives, but luckily for Mvelopes, I haven't find one"
3141,"Would be awesome if it worked , can't link bank account get an error everytime, contacted support they said they said they send an email when fixed 4 plus days later still doesn't work Not going to wait around for an app that may or may not work in the future.."
3142,"App is broken (again). I've been waiting for 2 years you have my one bank connectable (literally, not exaggerating). I'm paying for this service, and always seem to get the run around."
3143,"Edit:  I have been able to cancel the app subscription through the play store.  I'm so frustrated with this app. It isn't letting me update my budget, so I can't even use it. Can't get support, and can't seem to cancel it, so I'm stuck paying $4 per month for nothing!"
3144,Poor functionality. Won't let me adjust budget because it says I need to add income first despite me already adding my income. Then added income a second time and no option to delete income.
3145,"I am so frustrated with the app and the web site. I forgot my password on the app so I can sync to the website clicked the ""forget password"" link and I am taken to a page to sign up nothing else offered, no password help...nothing. I need to CANCEL my subscription"
3146,"I have been a happy customer for almost 9 years. Mvelopes used to have an excellent program and the customer service was prompt and always helpful. What happened? I am continually fighting glitches, the latest of which is a missing account, and I can't get help. Customer services is practically non-existent. This is not a free service and we are paying for incredible frustration and chaos with my accounts. The frustration and time spent on finding a work around on my own is not worth the cost"
3147,Ridiculous. I like the app I think. heard ot was real good and I want to start using it finally after paying for it for the last 3 months. Cant remember what my username is amd when I select cant remwmber the only option is to sign up and create a new account. ridiculous. there is no link to contact help or support so om hoping this review will get addeessed. ove also searched my emails and only got one where it told me my monthly fee was being debited.
3148,"Won't even open the app. Says ""We are unable to process your request. Please try again later."" If it can't even process the request to open the app how can I trust it with my budget."
3149,Buyer beware: I asked customer service to delete my credit card information in February because I was charged after cancelling my subscription. They said it was deleted but I was charged again nearly 9 months later in December.
3150,Installed app for it to be stuck on a blue screen which says something about being unable to process request. looked on the website which I don't have access to as I'm from the UK! Why have it in the UK play store then??
3151,Used to be great but completely useless now due to failed upgrades. Customer service is non existent. I have been unable to use the app on my phone for months... Yes months
3152,"Longterm user & paid for two Mvelopes accts (pers & biz), Mvelopes was no longer syncing. Contacted customer service & told program no longer compatible w/ my bank. After 10 months of incorrect bank data being synced, overcharge drafts bc of errors, & lack of customer support, I requested to cancel my accounts w/ refunds for 10 months that my accts were useless. As of 9/14/20, still no refunds AND I've been charged another year! My next stop is BBB and to contest with my bank for fraud charge."
3153,"Doesn't get past the loading screen. I have cleared cache, deleted the app and reinstalled, still not able to get it to work."
3154,I have downloaded this app several times and it disappears after a couple of days. They said it had to do with beta something. It makes no sense to me.
3155,"I downloaded this app, and was excited to try it out to help with my budgeting........ But the app and the website BOTH will not let me create an account?! Do they always have this problem? I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for a good budgeting app."
3156,"To cancel, they give you the ring around for months. They dont have customer service unless through text, and they say what they want to keep your money. Scam for sure. Take your money to a company that actually cares about their costumers and not just their money."
3157,The concept of this way to manage money is too complicated when translated to a digital format.
3158,"Installed then when open the app, just say ""we are unable to complete this request"" deleted and reinstalled 3 times and still the same thing"
3159,Faulty from the start. kept telling me to add a valid email and phone number even though my info was my correct information.
3160,The mobile app is ok. Need the browser based version for full functions. Browser based is Flash based. Flash is toast at end of 2020. MOVE away quickly!
3161,Lag time between a transaction and it registering on mvelopes is too long; needs to be instant otherwise what's the point?
3162,Tried to install twice and both times was given notification that due to an unexpected error it couldn't open... Please try again later. Nope.
3163,"Does not import transactions from account UI is over crowded .Too much manual entry where Account aync would save time,"
3164,Funny how an app for debt repayment assistance can actually help when charging a monthly subscription fee for this service.
3165,Doesn't connect to Scotiabank. Any other apps that use Finicity as their data aggregation service also fail to connect.
3166,Signed up online for 30 day trial and when I go to sign onto the mobile app it says invalid credentials... Can't even try out the app.
3167,"Doesn't give a free trial, wants me to pay now without even seeing anything in the app."
3168,App doesnt work. App wont sync up with bank info and jeeps try to get you to re enter your banking info every time you open app. Useless.
3169,Since the update to 5 I've had nothing but issues. Switching to another app.
3170,i have contacted tech support....my account balance is not transferring to my income cash pool. they haven't been able to help fix the issue. i guess I'll have to cancel my account.
3171,the app hasn't worked for me for a month now they wont fix it and just charge me wont return calls
3172,Keep getting an error when I open the app and can't enter the app at all. Reinstalled twice :(
3173,"I couldn't get the app to let me make an account.. The ""Create Account"" button stayed greyed out..."
3174,"app fails after upgrade, tons of complaints. obviously not alot of testing."
3175,Disappointed. I was excited to try this app out but unfortunately being an Australian resident I can not make an account because I don't have a US phone number. Big oversight from a development team.
3176,Just downloaded and can't get in. An unexpected error has occurred please try again.
3177,In the description it says this is a free trial and then you would need to purchase - but HOW MUCH IS IT? I don't want to go through the setup if I can't afford the app!
3178,"Downloaded it and can't even open it, comes up with error message. uninstalling it."
3179,what a joke. First off it REQUIRES you to give them your phone number. uh no that's none of your business. So I give a fake number. second I signup for a free trial but cannot use it instead it keeps harassing me to pay. therefore I can only assume this app is complete garbage and not worth paying for. uninstalled!
3180,I liked the idea but unfortunately the app and website are so buggy that its unusable
3181,I had no idea how to use this app because in order to use the help option you have to pay for the $19 a month subscription.
3182,"I forgot my username. So I select ""forgot username or password?"" And it requires me to enter my USERNAME??? Um.. I can't do that if I forgot my username. So now I am getting billed $6 a month and I can't get into my account. I went online and requested a password change through the ""help"" website and i never received an email with a password reset. What do I have to do regain access to my account?"
3183,I DIDNT USE IT OR KEEP IT AND IM STILL BEING CHARGED AFTER CANCELING!!! ABSOLUTELY STAY AWAY FROM THIS. I WANT MY MONEY REFUNDED ASAP. FILING DISPUTE WITH BANK.
3184,junk ap doesn't sync with web sit.
3185,"How do I delete unwanted envelopes? Also, how do I get answers to my questions without coming to the Play store? No response necessary...I'll find another, more simple, option."
3186,Doesn't recognize me when I sign in using username and password and won't let me cancel my account!
3187,this app is stealing $4 a month from me and I never used it.
3188,I can't open Mvelopes beta or Version 5 and my last version is now unavailable.
3189,I forgot my username and there's no way to recover it on the site or in the app.
3190,force closes whenever i try and sign up to select plan
3191,can't open - asks to try later and that's it
3192,Awful. Shoulnt have to pay for this
3193,Unable to open app
3194,Can't upgrade to Mv5
3195,Won't even open on my cool pad 😒
3196,can't access the app
3197,Wont even open.
3198,No Australian banks available
3199,"I love Mvelopes, but the mobile app does not work most of the time. I have tried reinstalling and sometimes that works, but most of the time I just get a pop-up ""An unexpected error has occurred, please try again at a later time."" There is not much point in using this system if I am unable to access the envelope balances when I'm away from my pc."
3200,Used to be a decent way to manage your budget now terrible responce to problems I have been waiting over a month to have them fix a problem
3201,without support in evenings or weekends you are crippled
3202,"I love Mvelopes, but the mobile app does not work most of the time. I have tried reinstalling and sometimes that works, but most of the time I just get a pop-up ""An unexpected error has occurred, please try again at a later time."" There is not much point in using this system if I am unable to access the envelope balances when I'm away from my pc."
3203,"This app has wonderful potential, but I too am experiencing an integration issue that has not been resolved. The workaround I've been provided is not an option as I'm not able to export transactions from my bank in the format required by Mvelopes. I've paid for the service and it's absolutely useless until this issue is resolved. Good luck speaking with anyone in support. My request for an update has gone unanswered and I've been waiting in a chat queue for over 3 hours to escalate."
3204,I pay for the premium service of this app but it simply doesn't work. As in literally does not pull in transactions correctly. I have been waiting for over a month for a response to a ticket and every time I reach out to development they just say they are working on it. Insane to pay for something that literally does not function. Would not recommend
3205,"can even start. downloaded press open, all I get error try later."
3206,"Not off to a great start. I downloaded today after a friend raved about this app. It is super glitchy and will not let me edit my envelope funds. Also finding the answers online is extremely difficult but the help service isn't open on weekends. For a subscription app, it would sure be great if it was user friendly. Some of the buttons/options that are supposed to be there just aren't. And I don't have a computer so this app is my only way. Please fix these issues ASAP."
3207,"No way to cancel. ""I forgot username"" link takes you to a form demanding your username and email, huh? No phone number on web site. No way to contact them to cancel."
3208,It's been almost a month now and I've heard nothing back from customer support about a fix to be able to add my bank account. I keep getting an error and ice tried several times to reach out but no one responds. It sucks to have paid for something that doesn't even work!
3209,Unexpected error while opening the all first time.. uninstalled the app
3210,without support in evenings or weekends you are crippled
3211,Used to be a decent way to manage your budget now terrible responce to problems I have been waiting over a month to have them fix a problem
3212,Awful. Shoulnt have to pay for this
3213,"Don't waste your money. App never worked as advertised. Requested support to fix my sync issues for 6 weeks. They never managed to fix them. What a frustrating waste of time. App is buggy, support responses are slow not a good experience. Tried several other apps that all had no problems syncing with my banks. Used the app and website over a year ago and thought coming back would be an improvement but it's much worse."
3214,"Very basic app...not sure why the bank account connection is available since you have to manually fund envelopes, expenses. Expected much more from a paid app."
3215,"Doesn't give a free trial, wants me to pay now without even seeing anything in the app."
3216,"I couldn't get the app to let me make an account.. The ""Create Account"" button stayed greyed out..."
3217,Do not get this app! I canceled my subscription through the Play Store & they deleted my account- but my card is still getting billed $59.99/mo. I can't get ahold of support because I don't have an active account anymore and can no longer log in. I'm going to have to change my card number to prevent losing $720/year. DO NOT GET THIS APP. It's not worth it!!
3218,My bank account consistently struggles to connect to this app. It will not recognize my long in and never updates correctly. It makes the app completely unfunctional. We have used this for years and it has consistently gotten more difficult and unreliable. Support is basically useless- even when we pay for the premium.
3219,"I have been using this budgeting tool for 10 years or more and have loved it and recommended it to others. But since they rolled out the update about a year ago, it has been very difficult to use, I have needed the assistance from customer service just to do basic things like sync accounts and now all my envelope balances are incorrect. I am a lifetime member so I hate to have to switch, but it has literally become unusable to me without starting over, so I guess this is goodbye..."
3220,Since the update to 5 I've had nothing but issues. Switching to another app.
3221,"Was ok a couple years ago but is horrible now. Bank balances don't update, customer service is now non-existent, and they won't let me into the phone app due to a change in subscriptions even though my annual subscription doesn't expire for 4 months!"
3222,03-21-2019: Created an account via browser along with a trial subscription. Tried to login with app and my credentials weren't recognized. Had to sign up again and ended up with two separate accounts using identical credentials. There's no obvious way to delete your account either. Trying to get them deleted now so I'm not charged for a broken service. 09-17-2020: Mvelopes account still hasn't been deleted and I still can't get ahold of someone smart enough to delete it. Avoid this service like the plague it is!
3223,"Longterm user & paid for two Mvelopes accts (pers & biz), Mvelopes was no longer syncing. Contacted customer service & told program no longer compatible w/ my bank. After 10 months of incorrect bank data being synced, overcharge drafts bc of errors, & lack of customer support, I requested to cancel my accounts w/ refunds for 10 months that my accts were useless. As of 9/14/20, still no refunds AND I've been charged another year! My next stop is BBB and to contest with my bank for fraud charge."
3224,"Since upgrading to 5.0 (which was a rocky experience itself), we've had problems with random envelopes showing an incorrect balance. Correctly performing addition and subtraction and showing an accurate envelope balance is a basic requirement and it's not being met. When we report the issue, Mvelopes corrects the balance, but within days it's wrong again. If we can't trust what our envelope balance is, we can't make good budgeting decisions."
3225,I have been using this app since its early years in 2010. I used to love it but would not recommend it to other users now. It has not been able to connect to my bank for over two months and customer service has been completely unhelpful. They suggested that I manually import my transactions to the app instead but the app gives me an error message every time I try and customer service only sends generic canned responses to my requests for assistance. I am frustrated and tired of paying for an app that doesn't work.
3226,"7/6/2020 Can't even login anymore, because it tells me to upgrade to mvelopes 5. But i have the newest version available. It did this to me about 6 months ago too. This is old. 9/6/2020 Nothing has changed. I'm still unable to login with this app. Very frustrating when I'm paying mvelopes to use it. Makes me want to change to a different company to budget my money."
3227,"The app is great...when it works. Really poor customer support though. I haven't been able to login to the mobile app since June (submitted a ticket on June 22) and the online app kicks me out every 5 minutes, even if I'm actively doing stuff in the app. Still no word on if/when they'll be able to fix my issues (and I've even paid for an annual membership). Very disappointed and will probably switch to a different app because of it."
3228,Doesn't connect to Scotiabank. Any other apps that use Finicity as their data aggregation service also fail to connect.
3229,"I have been a happy customer for almost 9 years. Mvelopes used to have an excellent program and the customer service was prompt and always helpful. What happened? I am continually fighting glitches, the latest of which is a missing account, and I can't get help. Customer services is practically non-existent. This is not a free service and we are paying for incredible frustration and chaos with my accounts. The frustration and time spent on finding a work around on my own is not worth the cost"
3230,I have downloaded this app several times and it disappears after a couple of days. They said it had to do with beta something. It makes no sense to me.
3231,The app on my phone and on my computer are no longer synced. The app on the phone wants me to sign up separately and doesn't give me any other options. Customer support is iffy. It looks like they're on a downward spiral but when it works it's probably still the best envelope budgeting out there. Important thing is whether it works or not. The whole new version of the app seems to have one little problem after another. UPDATE: Customer Service now responds quickly but doesn't resolve the problem
3232,"Have been using this app for a couple years now and, for the most part, have really enjoyed it. Version 5 seems to have killed it though?? US Bank will no longer connect to the app - message keeps saying there is nothing that can be done, and that I should manually input my transactions from US Bank accounts....what?! On the hunt to find a replacement as we speak..."
3233,"Used to be great. Mvelopes 4 had to be migrated from flash... Did some manager decided to re-invent the app? MV5 doesn't have the same basic features (transfer between accounts, reconcile)... that should have been a given. Boy I am truly disappointed. I am looking for alternatives, but luckily for Mvelopes, I haven't find one"
3234,I can't open Mvelopes beta or Version 5 and my last version is now unavailable.
3235,"Sad to leave but... My rating of this app is plummeting as I pay more for the app (it was five stars a few years ago). Limited customer service options, transactions show up multiple times after allocating them to an envelope, long delays in response times (or no reply at all), forcing what used to be optional (I don't want the app to track all my accounts from a bank, etc). I'm disappointed. Looking at other options and I've used mvelopes for years."
3236,They suck
3237,"I have had to change my review from a five star to a one star. I've used this app for years and loved it, but the new version is basically unusable. There are so many glitches and customer service is pretty much non-existent. It takes about a week to get a reply and the chat has an average of over 2 hours wait. I've been trying since May to get some issues resolved but nothing is happening. It continues to have duplicate transactions over and over again. I'm finally giving up on it."
3238,1. No option for account transfers in app 2. Accounts balance doesn't update after inputting account transaction 3. Downloaded transactions show multiple copies of same transaction. No really ready for prime time. Not really usable.
3239,Unable to open app
3240,"I had been a customer for 8 years. Originally the app and desktop web version were great. Performance has gone down hill with each update, to where it would regularly lose contact with banks and miss transactions. The most recent, it duplicated every account, after asking me to relogin to the bank, again... After three weeks of asking, and over 40 missing transactions, the best we got from customer service was to assign any duplicate money to an envelope and ignore it. No solution. We're done."
3241,The mobile app is ok. Need the browser based version for full functions. Browser based is Flash based. Flash is toast at end of 2020. MOVE away quickly!
3242,"This was a great app until TCF bank stopped syncing. I have been asking to have my account cancelled since February and nothing has worked! Chat didn't EVER RESPOND, phone number automatically hangs up. There is no support and no customer service. Save your money and use a different app."
3243,"I liked envelope budgeting... been using this app for 3 years... remains frustrating with many issues ... poor customers service..... and now we have to pay for that! Switching for better, hard to get worst! UPDATE 2020/06/18 NEVER AGAIN! They're don't care about customers..."
3244,App is continually crashing.
3245,UPDATE: switch to YNAB and never look back. Best decision I made. It seemed like it would be difficult but it has been well worth it. I've been using for 4 months. Been in communication with support. None of the bugs have been resolved. Just needs refinement. Works OK. UPdate: I just cancelled and received poor customer service. App simply doesn't work. Transactions disappear randomly while assigning an envelope. Try every dollar ...Better technology same price
3246,"I have used this app for years. I loved it at first and was able to get my budget under control. Unfortunately, ""improvements and updates"" have caused it to no longer function properly. I no longer receive notices in my phone off new purchases. Many charges are recorded multiple times and I could never find a way to delete them. (Doesn't appear to be possible) Tech support was no help. I have tried to continue using it for over a year and finally had to change to a different budgeting app."
3247,"Automatic bank transactions no longer post to my account, the system won't allow me to manually import transactions and tech support never gets back to you."
3248,"I forgot my username. So I select ""forgot username or password?"" And it requires me to enter my USERNAME??? Um.. I can't do that if I forgot my username. So now I am getting billed $6 a month and I can't get into my account. I went online and requested a password change through the ""help"" website and i never received an email with a password reset. What do I have to do regain access to my account?"
3249,Used to be great but completely useless now due to failed upgrades. Customer service is non existent. I have been unable to use the app on my phone for months... Yes months
3250,Keep getting an error when I open the app and can't enter the app at all. Reinstalled twice :(
3251,"I downloaded this app, and was excited to try it out to help with my budgeting........ But the app and the website BOTH will not let me create an account?! Do they always have this problem? I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for a good budgeting app."
3252,"This is a scam. I signed up for the 30 day free trial, but you can't actually use your account without fully committing to a subscription and paying them. You can't cancel your account during the 30 day free trial because you do not have access to the account settings that allow you to do that. There is no email contact info for this company anywhere, chat help does not exist. Huge waste of time and now I have to worry that they will charge my credit card without my permission. Good times. 👎"
3253,"I used to love this program and have used it for MANY YEARS. But in the year or so since they started the 'upgrade"" to version 5, it has been garbage. I'm looking for another program to use. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!"
3254,"Worst support for a paid service. Canceling my subscription has been a BATTLE since I can't remember my username - can't cancel from the app even if you're logged in (for some reason, even tho I signed up through the app, subs may only be cancelled through the web). Trying to get support to help me find my username has been a mess. I'm now in my 9th hour trying to get through to support. Ticketing system says I'm 54th in line - then 97th. Suddenly 1st, and I miss it for lunch. Just walk away."
3255,Just downloaded and can't get in. An unexpected error has occurred please try again.
3256,I forgot my username and there's no way to recover it on the site or in the app.
3257,Can't upgrade to Mv5
3258,"Wouldn't let me create a password so I can't use it... It kept telling me to add special characters, which I did. It still wouldn't accept it Also, it really makes the app seem fishy when the terms of use check box is the same as the email list check box."
3259,"We had 1 account for many years & opened another account under a different email & bank account because we liked it. After about 9 months they just deleted our first main account & we were never notified. Never able to connect with anyone other than chat since there is no phone or email availability by mvelopes. Chatting kept telling us someone will call, never did. We left Feb 3 and found another budget system. All we got was an email stating ""sorry to see you go""...from a ""no reply"" email."
3260,The app and website are totally broken. I can't log in to either and chat support no longer exists and email support won't respond. I pay for a service that I cannot even log into to cancel my account and export my data. Avoid this app and service or your data will be held hostage as well.
3261,"Great app amazing and I absolutely love it 5+ stars when it works.... If this app were a car it would be the 2018 Ford Escape, engine blows up after 6k miles. It doesn't matter how good it is and how many features it has if it isn't reliable. My account will spontaneously not log in and not update my budget. The app will tell me to try again later, 2+ wks later I have to ask them to fix it manually. Keep changing my review from 5 stars for service to 1 star every time there is another problem"
3262,Tried to install twice and both times was given notification that due to an unexpected error it couldn't open... Please try again later. Nope.
3263,Won't even open on my cool pad 😒
3264,Buyer beware: I asked customer service to delete my credit card information in February because I was charged after cancelling my subscription. They said it was deleted but I was charged again nearly 9 months later in December.
3265,I liked the idea but unfortunately the app and website are so buggy that its unusable
3266,Funny how an app for debt repayment assistance can actually help when charging a monthly subscription fee for this service.
3267,"App is broken (again). I've been waiting for 2 years you have my one bank connectable (literally, not exaggerating). I'm paying for this service, and always seem to get the run around."
3268,"The app is horribly slow, doesn't connect to all banks and doesn't feel intuitive at all! As other reviewers have mentioned canceling from the ""Free Trial"" is a pain. The link to cancel via the web app displays an obviously built in message that they are having difficulty and to contact the live chat or send an email. Email does not provide an option for cancellation support and their live chat agents are completely useless as they say they have to send an email on my behalf to cancel. I wish I never attempted to try this app because now I am going to have to fight any charges attempted while I am working on confirming my cancellation which will take up my time. Even when I went to leave feedback after my chat session I got all the way to the last question (titled ""Question Fourth"") and upon hitting submit was met with an error page. I DO NOT TRUST THIS APP or the company behind it. It should be as easy to cancel as they make it to upgrade my subscription."
3269,Wont even open.
3270,doesnt sync with mvelopes 5 so constantly get notified about unassigned transactions. Nope that's not the problem. Probably because I'm beta user and locked to old version. Please fix beta program
3271,Since the update there has been NOTHING BUT ISSUES. It makes the program unusable
3272,App just spins on launch. Fantastic usage of $4 a month.
3273,"To cancel, they give you the ring around for months. They dont have customer service unless through text, and they say what they want to keep your money. Scam for sure. Take your money to a company that actually cares about their costumers and not just their money."
3274,Lag time between a transaction and it registering on mvelopes is too long; needs to be instant otherwise what's the point?
3275,App doesnt work. App wont sync up with bank info and jeeps try to get you to re enter your banking info every time you open app. Useless.
3276,No Australian banks available
3277,"Would be awesome if it worked , can't link bank account get an error everytime, contacted support they said they said they send an email when fixed 4 plus days later still doesn't work Not going to wait around for an app that may or may not work in the future.."
3278,Poor functionality. Won't let me adjust budget because it says I need to add income first despite me already adding my income. Then added income a second time and no option to delete income.
3279,"I used to love this app. Now that it's a paid app, it has become extremely slow. I'm looking at other apps to replace this one. - I have tried contacting their custom support several times to resolve a payment issue, but as usual I never heard from them. Would not recommend this is company."
3280,I have used this service for over 2 years. Since the update and move to Mvelopes 5 I have been very unhappy. I cannot look at spending trends on the same page as my envelopes any more. You must manually figure your average spending vs funding... in the past you could do this on the inbox page. Whoever had the bright Ideal to change this was not so bright. Its also slow on pulling in transactions from Capital One. I would suggest finding another app. There are a lot out there that will work better than this. Mvelopes you should go back to the old set up and sue your web developer....
3281,"used to love it but it did something funny so I deleted it hoping to reinstall. Now, It won't even let me do that. Grr! *Spent some time with support team. They couldn't figure out the problem so they moved it to some other department. I was told they would email me when the problem is solved. That was weeks ago. No resolution."
3282,"How do I delete unwanted envelopes? Also, how do I get answers to my questions without coming to the Play store? No response necessary...I'll find another, more simple, option."
3283,"8/18/19. updating to give new reason for rating. a ""bug fix"" was deployed and updated by unallocated mvelope balance to -199k all of a sudden. contacted support and they asked what the balance should be, and couldn't see history. tried calling multiple times, long wait, not good follow up after live chat didn't fix issue. i have zero confidence in data integrity the account is a mess, headed over to ynab and starting over even after I paid for a lifetime membership. very disappointed. 4/19/19. downgrading my positive review to negative. they upgraded the computer app but didnt put out a new version on mobile. killed my ability to conveniently update/manage my budget. will be cancelling lifetime membership if they dont get a new mobile app out soon. and really dont like new app change where you must select a fund date. makes it impossible to fund all your mvelopes at the beginning of the month and see balance reduced. totally negates the premise of the app being an envelope."
3284,"Spent hours on the website & app trying to get them to work as intended. Mvelopes5 started the weekend I opened my account. I gave up after a few months. Might be worth it if they get the bugs worked out but take the free version for a month or 2. Once you pay canceling is a hassel with them. You have to email that you want to cancel, then you have to reply to an email received to explain why, then you need to follow up to confirm they cancelled THEN they cancel. Still charging as you wait."
3285,app is broken. i haven't been able to use on my pixel 2 in over a month. extremely frustrated. this is unacceptable
3286,"We really wanted to try Mvelopes, unfortunately I can only log in from the website, but the app says incorrect password every time I try to log in. Update: tried with a different email and it still doesn't sync from web accounts and app accounts. customer support wanted me to send them a ton of information to try to solve the problem. The entire point of wanting to try this app was for ease of use.. definitely not worth it. I will use a better supported app for my family."
3287,Ridiculous. I like the app I think. heard ot was real good and I want to start using it finally after paying for it for the last 3 months. Cant remember what my username is amd when I select cant remwmber the only option is to sign up and create a new account. ridiculous. there is no link to contact help or support so om hoping this review will get addeessed. ove also searched my emails and only got one where it told me my monthly fee was being debited.
3288,i have contacted tech support....my account balance is not transferring to my income cash pool. they haven't been able to help fix the issue. i guess I'll have to cancel my account.
3289,Poor user interface online. Was told the v5 app is not functioning correctly. iPhones rolled out in January. customer service gave me a direct download link for an apk file which didn't work. I'm not paying a monthly subscription for something that has an app not being fixed since January- 7 months later
3290,what a joke. First off it REQUIRES you to give them your phone number. uh no that's none of your business. So I give a fake number. second I signup for a free trial but cannot use it instead it keeps harassing me to pay. therefore I can only assume this app is complete garbage and not worth paying for. uninstalled!
3291,junk ap doesn't sync with web sit.
3292,"Had good potential as a useful app, but I have never in my life experienced such horrible customer service, they are infuriatingly frustrating. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Use YNAB it does basically the same thing, it does cost more but they understand how customer support and service works."
3293,"Installed then when open the app, just say ""we are unable to complete this request"" deleted and reinstalled 3 times and still the same thing"
3294,I DIDNT USE IT OR KEEP IT AND IM STILL BEING CHARGED AFTER CANCELING!!! ABSOLUTELY STAY AWAY FROM THIS. I WANT MY MONEY REFUNDED ASAP. FILING DISPUTE WITH BANK.
3295,this app is stealing $4 a month from me and I never used it.
3296,Installed app for it to be stuck on a blue screen which says something about being unable to process request. looked on the website which I don't have access to as I'm from the UK! Why have it in the UK play store then??
3297,can't open - asks to try later and that's it
3298,"I am so frustrated with the app and the web site. I forgot my password on the app so I can sync to the website clicked the ""forget password"" link and I am taken to a page to sign up nothing else offered, no password help...nothing. I need to CANCEL my subscription"
3299,Doesnt work
3300,"Edit:  I have been able to cancel the app subscription through the play store.  I'm so frustrated with this app. It isn't letting me update my budget, so I can't even use it. Can't get support, and can't seem to cancel it, so I'm stuck paying $4 per month for nothing!"
3301,In the description it says this is a free trial and then you would need to purchase - but HOW MUCH IS IT? I don't want to go through the setup if I can't afford the app!
3302,"It was painful to go through, and even after having my phone number it couldn't save the currency, and I had to manually change it. I would not recommend this app to anyone thinking to budget mass amounts of money, or use it professionally."
3303,"The app was very nice until now, i really don't know what happened but the graph is not working anymore, in fact i think is crashed somehow because also the settings button is nit working. Maybe is due to the year chage but please do something."
3304,I downloaded the app... it sent me a verification code (several times) but no place to put the verification code. The currency appeared to be in yens and the gear would not work for settings. my credit union recommended this app but it must be for only iPhones because I couldn't get it to do anything not even give me a place to put the code. I have a Google Pixel phone.
3305,"It keeps crashing after the latest update. It's been 3 days since, you have to do something"
3306,"Keep crashing when open App in Note 9, cannot even try. Too bad, App looks nice."
3307,"Settings button does not work, great start, here is the point where i don't try any further XD"
3308,Overview chart and settings button don't work
3309,Crashes all the time
3310,Too confusing I don't get why the settings won't work I have literally no clue on how to use this app
3311,The app keeps stopping.

3321,Crashes all the time
3322,"This service is absolutely terrible and a scam. Not nearly one of the better apps/services to save money or invest and it's literally impossible to close your account on your own. Absolute insane process which requires you to wait for customer support to get around to you, meanwhile you're being charged while you wait. Great system🙄"
3323,I used to really like this app. It helped me save a ton of money but for the past few days I kept getting the error message that Qapital couldn't be reached. Reached out to customer support and they told me I had no internet connection to the app which makes zero sense. How is Qapital the only app I have that won't connect to the internet? My bank account randomly unconnected before a day before this happened too. Too many strange connection issues. Super disappointed and uninstalled.
3324,Poor customer service. You cannot get ahold of an actual person if an issue arises. I have been a loyal user for years but when I had an issue they have made it more difficult to get a solution and their response is just to wait days possibly a week after the initial waiting period for something that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. I have lost all confidence in their ability to handle my money and now I will have to wait a minimum of a week to be able to use or transfer it out.
3325,I heard about this app and wanted to try it to help me automate my saving. It costs $6/month to use!! This expense is much higher than my current monthly banking fees and seems extreme when the goal is to help people save money.
3326,Came here because I read online it was free. :(. Trying to get away from digits fee but they charge even more
3327,Note to self: This app charges a subscription fee. You aren't interested. Stop downloading it thinking it can improve your finances. Subscriptions are drains. Bye.
3328,"I loved this app but despite reconnecting it to my bank account, it doesn't want to transfer any money. Then what am I paying for? I'm paying for my money to just sit somewhere when I could have that free. :("
3329,Haven't used this app in over a year since they started having so many connection issues with my bank. Last week I withdrew some funds from my robinhood and I didn't realize that I had my qapitol account number in robinhood (I thought it was my cashapp) and it went to my Qapitol spending. I don't have a debit card and they won't let me withdraw the funds to my bank which is still listed in Qapitol as my funding account. So I have $58 in an account that I can't even access. Thanks qapitol!😤
3330,"Had to order new debit card. They shut off the old one and I ordered my card on Jan. 4th, 2021. I am still waiting for it! My paycheck has been deposited to my account and I can not access my money to pay bills or anything else. New development. My paycheck goes straight to this account every month. Because my deposit happened twi minutes after my auto withdrawl of another payment they returned my payment!!! HOW STUPID. BOTH WITHDRAWAL AND DEPISIT DONE ON SAME DAY!!!"
3331,Impossible to remove your bank account from this terrible app. Been trying for years. Customer service does nothing to help. Worst app I've ever got trapped in.
3332,Legitimately terrible. No phone support is incredibly concerning since they are handling your money. The time it takes for funds to transfer and settle is ridiculous. Every other app on the planet has figured out a way to make transfers between financial institutions seamless but Qapital hasn't figured it out yet. It would take less time to walk your money to the bank a penny at a time. Don't put your money into this app. It would be better off buried in a hole in the woods.
3333,"I've loved this app for many years, but got a new phone & trying to log back in. It's saying a 2 step authentication is now required - please update & there is no update available. Can not login to transfer my funds, contact support. Anything. There better be a way for me to get my money..."
3334,"Liked the app, then it stopped linking with my bank account and the difficulty trying to get it fixed made me decide to just cancel. Contacted support to close the account and the steps they give don't work on app. Support can't do it/don't respond to email requests, so I'm paying a monthly fee for an app that doesn't work and I can't close. Not sure what's going on with their recent updates but I would stay far, far away and not recommend letting them anywhere near your money."
3335,"I really enjoy this app at first but it has some huge glitches that continually cause overdrafts. BEWARE!!!!!! They make it damn near impossible to change your accounts and run up service fees on old accounts. If your goal is to help your customers save why keep charging us and running up overdraft fee? Very poorly run app, and id advise using any of the other saving app. This is just a cheap knock off saving / money grab app now."
3336,"Was able to save away a good deal of money with this app, then they updated their system and my phone can no longer access their server. I can't find any back up way to access my account, (everything the tells me to get the app from the play store) and they are sitting on hundreds of dollars that belong to me but I can no longer access. They have lost my trust."
3337,"This banking app has been down for 2 days now. There's no blog post, email, or in app message in response to this. A quick look at Twitter reveals that basically everyone has been locked out and your keep directing them to a support email that implies that this error has to do with an individual issue opposed to your entire app not working. Imagine using qapital for your main chequing account and not being to access your money for 2 whole days. Fix it and own up to your mistakes."
3338,I wish I could give this app 0 stars. They stole from me for 6 months the $6 membership fee because they refused to refund me or transfer the $0.01 I had left in my account. You can't cancel a membership until your account is 0. They have no number to call for customer service so you have to wait for someone to open your message online which takes hours. This is the WORST app I have ever used I really wish I could give it 0 stars
3339,"App updated on Jan 15th, now unable to login. Am on the newest version. Goes to login screen after my ""token"" expired and now when trying to login just stays on that screen but will flash ""please wait"" over and over when hitting login and never go anywhere. Please fix so I can access my money."
3340,Do not use this service. I tried logging in the other day and it says I need to create an account even though I have had one for almost 2 years now. There is nowhere to log in and every time I go through the set up process all I get is a user with this phone number already exists. So I now have no access to 2 years worth of saving up and investing. I reached out to support and no response yet.
3341,"They claim to have a system that prevents overdraft fees when your account is less than $100 but that's not true. When I got paid I was notified that the savings would resume and immediately after I got the notification, I transferred money to my savings so that it was less than $100. The next day they still transferred money although I had $30 in my account and charged an overdraft fee. I contacted customer service and was told there system works, it was my banks fault and would not refund."
3342,"Update: Although customer service has been in contact with me, I am not getting any closer to getting access. I was asked to provide my email address and phone number that I used to register which I did. Instead of getting access I got another requesting a picture of my driver license and upload of my bank statements connected to the account. This does not sound right and I am NOT comfortable with this request. All I need is to have access to my account. I will be filing a report with the BBB."
3343,"Updated the app tonight and now it won't even let me login. I hit the login button, and the screen just flashes, and stays on the same screen. Less than thrilled I can't access my money. This needs to be fixed ASAP."
3344,"The app was great for managing saving goals. Although app security updates are essential, the recent update rollout has been poorly implemented. Now, I'm having issues accessing my funds. Customer support is abysmal."
3345,"I have not had any problems until today!! I went to log in, but it asked me to update my log in...I changed my password, but now it won't let me in. It's saying ""later"", nah...I want access now!!"
3346,It's all well and good until it doesn't pull your savings until two weeks later and then it overdrafts your bank account. Just getting a savings account from a bank. Jesus it's frustrating.
3347,Customer service has not been helpful regarding my inability to log into the app. I have made several attempts and their unhelpful response time is tremendously slow. BEWARE.
3348,"Bank of America not supported? Seems kind of crazy to me. Had issues for days linking my account. Once I was FINALLY redirected to Plaid, I'm informed Bank of America is not supported. Deleting the app. It's been nothing but a hassle since installing it."
3349,The app won't even let me link my bank. Just keeps sending me in a circle. Frankly not worth the trouble when it won't even let you set up your account.
3350,"Trying to login, it tells me it needs 2FA and to update my app but my apps already updated and theres no way to sign in to give me the code it texts me. Useless!"
3351,My experience was GREAT AT 1ST but now the app WILL NOT allow me 1.to take money from my qapital savings 2. Customer service sucks (they WILL NOT allow me to talk to a human) 3. The rules don't even work. So at the end of the day great idea POOR EXECUTION.
3352,update 3/10: customer service will ignore your questions if they do not know the answer. they froze my account for no reason is my assumption because they didnt reply. do not deposit large amount of money because they will lock your whole account until what they call settlement period is over. you cannot use your money even money that was available before deposit. they have no system that lets them hold only the funds that are waiting for settlement. they do not care if you have bills to pay.
3353,The app and the website won't let me log in. I resetted my password and still doesn't work. Its been more than a week now.
3354,I can't log in my account. I just changed my password and every time i log in it only freeze on the log in page. This is scaring me. I still have money on my account and still connected to my bank account.
3355,I can't even access my account I want to cancel my membership and can't even do that. Very frustrating. I deleted the app and reinstalled and it's still useless.
3356,Like so many others I cannot access my account. It said token expired. Reset my password. Now can't log in on app (internal server error) or web. They have my money hostage and I can't even unlink my bank account. FURIOUS. THEY HAVE STOLEN OUR HARD EARNED MONEY.
3357,I got money saved in this app. And all of a sudden it stops working. I can't access to my account online or in the app. I really need my money now.
3358,1 star because it is so difficult to close and delete my account. Should not be so difficult!
3359,"Never download this app they charge you to use your own money and it never let you close your account, worst app ever"
3360,"I don't know why I can't log in to get my money! This is sad! What are yall doing? Had no issues for years, now I can't login!"
3361,I just downloaded the app but when you slide the tab to link your finacial institutions it will not continue. I did click on the accept terms. Any way to get this fixed?
3362,Started off good then the service and app functionality gets worse by the week
3363,Heard great things about this app but the bug when attempting to link won't even let me use it. So now I have to pay 6 dollars a month for an unusable app?
3364,"App is not working, even after the update. Please fix"
3365,"Was not able to complete set up app keep glitching out, very disappointing"
3366,"They'll steal your money, and there's no way to contact them and ask them to return it. Don't use them, just put it in a savings account. Their customer service is nonexistent. And they consistently charge me $6 for...?"
3367,I have been trying to login into this app and look at my money for the past week and no luck. What's going on with the app? Why can't I log in? Is my money being stolen?
3368,"I tried to set up an account, the ""create account"" button just sends you to app download. It may be something I'm doing wrong, but who knows? Ya gotta let me know."
3369,"QAPITAL RECENTLY STOLE ALL MY MONEY!!!!! Beware of this app. I had an account set up, they recently did a security update and wiped my account out. I had OVER $3000 on my app account. They keep telling me there is no account using my email. No one from support@qapital is responding to any of my emails that I sent to them from my account email address. THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER TO CALL. I AM IN TEARS"
3370,"I have not been able to access my account for years and support is no help. Thank God I took my money out before this mess. The app is great, but lord forbid you run into any issues because they don't have phone support, and I reached out years ago to no avail. Thank God I took my money out, or I could have lost access to hundreds of dollars with no help on supports part on being able to get into my account. Had this issue since 2018, it's now 2021. I dodged a bullet with this app."
3371,"This app has gone downhill. The day my paycheck was deposited into my account, another transaction came through and they returned the transaction! Never heard of this kind of nonsense before. I will start looking for a new app and move my money!!!!!!!"
3372,Don't expect it to be easy to cancel. I have been trying to cancel my membership for a few days and it is nearly impossible. Sure you can take away the funding account but they still have your banking information and you cannot delete your account. Definitely not worth it.
3373,"I am pissed right now. I went to look at my account and was prompted to login again. I did and it said my pass code was wrong. No biggie I changed my pass code. Now im getting a error message that I tried logging in too many times and I have to try again later. When is later? I don't like not having access to my account. Up until this point I liked this app, however this has pissed me off. Once I'm able to get back into my account I'm shutting it down. Not a happy customer at all."
3374,"Put the rating low to be seen. This app has been great up until today? It won't let me log in. Just says please wait then stops loading, like it's not even trying to let me in. Problems like this should honestly be non-existent for an all that deals with your money, I'm honestly going to have to stop using it because this is unacceptable. It's very serious when dealing with money to not let you in your account!!!!"
3375,"A friend sent me the referral code but I keep getting an error 7. I've reached out to support but I've not received a response, I did finally look on Facebook and saw that many users are having the same issue. Hopefully this gets resolved or I'll definitely find another app like it that isn't having so many issues."
3376,"That app has forced signed me out and won't allow me to sign back in. I even went through the process of resetting my password and still am denied access due to an ""Error: 7"". When I try to contact support I get sent back to the sign in page. This is honestly ridiculous and infuriating! I want access to my money now !"
3377,"8:56 PM, Jan/15, STILL NOT WORKING, VERSION UPDATED, I called at 3:20 est, left a message. I received a message stating my ""token expired"". I updated my password & a new error message ""7"" occurred, multiple times. I received a message that maybe there was fraud so I called Shazam , Qapitals' fraud department. I spoke with Shazam, no fraud. Guess what? STILL NO CALL FROM QAPITAL. I spoke to a third party that works with Qapital BEFORE I even talked to Qapital about login issue. I NEED MY $$ !!"
3378,"Never had an issue until 5 DAYS AGO!!! They locked my account, still locked, with all of my savings and stopped responding after I provide proof of high dollar amount transactions. I've reached out on multiple platforms after them stating a 24hr response time with no response. Got a simple follow up email stating they are looking into it! I am EXTREMELY IRRITATED THAT MY ACCOUNT IS LOCKED AFTER 5 DAYS AND SHOWING PROOF THAT THE TRANSACTION ARE AUTHENTIC."
3379,"Shut my account down for no reason. After promoting them for years and having 10 of thousands of dollars saved with the app, recommend Digit instead"
3380,Terrible!! I have no plan and the app still takes money from my account. Customer service is terrible and the people there are useless. This app is a thief and in order for it to be better it should be destroyed and built from scratch!
3381,"Extremely upset. I am trying to access my qapital account to pause the rules that are set up and I opened the app, and it's making me login again. Tried to login, nothing works. Reset my password, can't get in. Reset again, still can't get in. Tried to click on the link from the reset password email to get in contact with support, and it takes me to the login page AGAIN and I STILL CAN'T LOGIN. How am I supposed to get in contact with support about not being able to login if I can't login??"
3382,Great app. Horrible customer service experience. If something goes wrong they will send you a bunch of automated responses and make excuses but then a couple weeks later someone will finally repsond and make it known you are on their valuable time. Learn the basics. Value your customers. If you guys only knew the client's they support... You would never let them touch your money. Beware... if you make any mistake. It will be a long time before your money comes back and that's still a big if...
3383,"It was good when I first got it and it was free. In fact I use to love the app. Now they began to charge me $8 a month to keep my debit card and be able to use their features, the monthly charge has to be paid with an external account instead of your Qapital spending account which makes no sense to me as I had Direct Deposit, it's no longer worth it, now it's a headache and it cost you money. Simple & Chime are free and have great features, they are looking tempting, I'm looking into those now."
3384,This is the 2nd and final time I've had a major issue Trying to withdraw money out of my account. I am at a place of business needing to Withdraw a large amount of money And every time I log in I get a error message I have tried for over an hour to log in And now being highly embarrassed I must go home. I cannot and will not bank with a company that 1 locks your account when they want then require you to submit 5 different pieces of ID to verify it's u. Or when you log in u get error messages.
3385,"I've had this app for years and successfully saved money for vacations. But I just got an email they are moving to a ""membership model"" and now i'll be charged $8 a month. This is with a 33% ""discount"" for being a long time customer. That is just ridiculous. I went into the app and paused my rules, and began moving forward to deactivate my account and saw I was charged $3 when I turned off my round up rule, I'm being charged to stop using them?? I hope this is a misunderstanding, I contacted support and hope to hear from them soon. I'm very upset, I've always recommended and talked highly of Qapital to all my friends- but this move is not good. This app worked for years without this membership stuff, why change now? I'll be withdrawing my money and deactivating my account as soon as I can. I'm sad to go, but I can't support this change."
3386,"BEWARE!!! Membership fee is a $60 surprise (no warning) months after you sign up. I guess they wait until you aren't paying attention any longer. The app is very hard to maneuver. It takes clicking every section and menu to find what you are looking for. Even the help section keeps bringing up the option of ""never mind"" when searching for your answer. It is so frustrating I suppose they hope you will give up. Activity and pending transfers in Qapital app don't match your bank account"
3387,Saved money only to have it stolen can't withdraw money capital keeps giving excuses as to why I can't get my money first account won't connect then system is down then it takes 3 weeks to Get a live rep to reply don't give capital your money
3388,"The app WAS great!! I became an early member when it was free. Then about a year ago, early membership was free, new members paid a fee to join. Now they are charging everyone even those who joined early. They reneged on what they said, and to me that's shady business. If I can't trust you with your words, I DEFINITELY CAN'T TRUST YOU WITH MY MONEY!!✌🏾"
3389,"Unfortunately this app has become useless to me. They lost the connection to my bank months ago (March/April) and it has never returned. It was a great way for me to save and I cannot find another app that works the same way. Pity! I referred a few people and they have also lost connection to their bank so they have uninstalled, too. I tried to wait, wait, wait. Ill just have to move on. You attempted to help via support but it did not fix the issue. You no longer support Capital One bank."
3390,"EDIT 11/12/2019: Was a great app, easy to use, etc. I even had their debit card. However, their decision to start charging for service means I'll be cancelling and deleting my account. Furthermore, they decided that the best way to implement the new system was to just automatically charge people, rather than allowing people to opt-in or out first."
3391,Somethings going on with app where it has kicked me out of my account and won't let me log back in with correct email and password combo even after resetting pass word. Please FIX ASAP!!!
3392,"I do love this app and it was working for awhile but I am having trouble with it now and support is really hard to reach. It's been roughly 3 days and still nothing. My transfers have all been paused despite having money, and it even shows recent transactions so I know it is connected. Tried unlinking account but it wouldn't let me. I see other reviews and people are having issues with reaching support as well, regardless of the issue."
3393,"This app is a great tool, but they have zero respect for their customers. I have been using Qapital almost since the beginning, when it was still a 100% free service. When they first introduced memberships, I received an email stating I would be grandfathered in to their top tier at no cost for life. This morning, I got an email where that offer was rescinded. Disgusting. I'll be looking for an alternative app."
3394,"After using this app since beta testing, I have had enough. I was locked out of my entire account for not having enough money to cover a (1) transaction that took several hours of copy-pasted messages to get ""rectified."" Only I find that my account continued to be locked or that something was wrong on the backend that I had no control over continuing to block access to my money. Now my card has been disabled, with no warning, and no notification of such action. I'll take my business elsewhere"
3395,This app will not allow me to log in. I receive an Error message 7:. I have updated as well as uninstalled then reinstalled. I need to be able to access my money!
3396,Why was $6 dollars just taken from my bank account?!?!? I don't even use this app anymore. I'm having my hard earned money get stolen from me!
3397,Signed up a few years back and thought it was a great way to save with the round up rules. Now I'm deleting because I'm getting charged a monthly fee because I have a debit card. The whole idea was to save then be able to use the money for the goal. Got the debit card so I didn't have to wait for money to transfer. So I stopped my rules and transfered my remaining balance back. But some how in the last transfer money is missing. Its showing in the app that I withdrew the funds but I transfered.
3398,"Worked great at first, saved $400 THEN it stopped linking to my bank. Spent weeks with tech support with no luck. Kept blamimg my bank but other family members have no problems. Once they ran out of ideas no more contact. Only way to get money back is to get a different account. Not going to open another account for them. Had to get there debit card to retrieve savings. Too bad I would have liked to have continued."
3399,"I love this app but the support is COMPLETELY hard to get in touch with...you have to email them or call but when you call it takes hours for them to call back, you can never get someone right away like a normal call center would be ready to take a call. Thankfully the fraud dept they hire out (vendor), is WAY better customer service than they have... but if you have a problem with your card other than fraud..good luck...I wish there was a zero star option."
3400,"Good concept but had too many difficulties getting the account to set up and link to my banks. I had to cancel my account after numerous attempts and contacting customer service. The customer service reps where were great, but unfortunately I really don't want to have keep emailing back and forth for what should be a fairly simple set up to an account."
3401,"Worked fine at first, but then took several days for 'rules' (roundups) to complete. I then had numerous frustrations with the app freezing ('Can't reach Qapital right now!')  After too many delays, I cashed out my savings goal and am trying to delete my account altogether -- NONE of the instructions on your site work and I do NOT want my account information listed.  Please advise on how cancel and delete once and for all!"
3402,"I still have the email that I got where it said since I've been loyal for so many years the app would be free for life. Now all of a sudden they're charging $8 a month. Shady. I liked the app, but this was disappointing. Also I now bank with chime and I cant link my account ad a funding account so I'll be canceling my membership and deleting my account. Not gonna pay for something I can no longer use."
3403,"Great ideo and concept...good luck to you if anything ever happens to your account, customer support is non exhistant. You can't get anyone on the phone. They make you go through this BS email automated system. I have been dealing with an issue on my card being locked for over a month.... They refer me to a 3rd party security company. They 3rd party company tells me to contact qapital. qapital told me to contact them again...lmao what a joke. If I could get someone on the phone it would be fixed."
3404,Horrible experience. Caused several overdrafts and locked me out of my account by saying there was a fraud alert but of course they kept charging the $6 fee even though I couldn't use the account. And customer service is non existent. It takes a week at a time to get a response back from them. Would never use their services or recommend them again.
3405,It was great having this service. Unfortunately they gave me a notice of there new payment terms and I did not want to have another monthly payment. So I tried to close my account. They now will not allow me to withdraw or change my plan until their new payment plans roll out forcing me to pay the bill. They are currently excepting money in but won't let it out. I feel very taken advantage of.
3406,It is a great app but it is NO longer free to use. I feel like there should be free (but limited) services as an option. Also if you put money in Qapital it takes a few days to transfer back to your account unless you have a spending card with the app. All in all I have saved lots of money with the app but I can't reccomend it for my friends in their 20 somethings now because they won't/can't pay to use it. If you can/will pay the fee it's worth it! But i'll be looking for new options.
3407,"It takes several days for funds to transfer over. Once funds have been taken from your bank account, you cannot access them for 4 days. After that, you can transfer them in 1 businesses day for a fee, or 2 business days. Which makes this account useless for emergency expenses. Ended up closing the account as they won't change your address without a utility in your name (mine are all in my partners), or a credit card statement, which I don't have. So I had no way of changing my address."
3408,"While signing up the app never notified me of a subscription charge. I only found out when I checked my bank account to find out quapital was automatically withdrawing money from an account I didn't have it in when i never had goals. The main problem is that it never told me there was going to be a fee for useing the app. T herefore, I didn't put money in my card because I wasn't planning on using it and now have damaged credit and an overdraft fee when I can barely afford my necessities."
3409,"They started charging a free to be a member so I thought that was the time to say my goodbyes and delete the app. I took my savings back, but had to contact customer service to unlink my back account. An annoying process that took days. It should not be a hassle to unlink.This was in 11/2019. Now I get an email 12/2020 saying the issue has been resolved. I re-download the app and find out they relinked my bank account and have to go through this again."
3410,"The security of this app is ridiculous. In order to make any changes to anything on your account you have to contact customer support. And guess what, no customer service number! They expect you to mail/email them all this ridiculous information just to make a change on your own account. That's stupid and inconvenient as hell. If they could make it easier to manage the information on your account this would be a 10 star app."
3411,"They let you add accounts for them to peak into no problem. But trying to switch the one you send and receive money from involves contacting support since the option within the app doesn't work. They told me they require my phone number now. Want to cancel your account? The bot needs your phone number to find your account... But you don't have my phone number... I need to cancel and get my money out of the app. Used to be useful, now it's just another app front for traditional bank practices."
3412,"Excellent app with one MAJOR problem: support. If you don't ever have a need for support, you will love this app. But if you do, beware! I've been chatting with support for over 2 weeks now and not only has my issue not been resolved, they are terribly unresponsive and even rude. When you are actually paying a monthly fee for a service like Qapital, this kind of lousy support is inexcusable."
3413,Was great when I first got it. Things have changed alot and now its just a pain. Plus they now want you to pay a minimum membership fee. Im trying to save money not spend it. To the editor who replied to this review. There are no membership fees associated with my account because I canceled it once you rolled out the fees. Don't be a smart ass.
3414,"I signed up many months ago, but eventually decided to not use their service. Got an email from them on an account I don't monitor much anymore that they would be charging me starting later this month. Had I not checked, I would be charged for a service I'm no longer using. That's just wrong on so many levels. I should not be opted into paying automatically. Shady practices. I advise not using this company. Edit: The company's response below leaves out that you are Automatically. Opted-In. To. This. Paid. Tier. That is never acceptable."
3415,Stay away from. I would really rate negative stars if able. Robinhood and similar apps are better and free. And easier to unlink bank account. This company won't allow you to remove and delete account without the run around. It is a scam. Stay away from.
3416,"Used to be a great app. They didn't pay any interest, they kept it for themselves, to pay for the service. I have no issue with that. Now they want to charge a nice hefty fee on top of that. And automatically sign me up to pay for it No thanks. My bank can provide the same service, just without the fancy app, for no charge. It was good while it lasted"
3417,"I have a credit union and when I tried adding the checking and saving accounts the app didnt recognize the institution and I'm assuming that's why it took longer than usual to get it added. I had it for about a month and all of a sudden it stopped working. For the last 2 months I've been trying to pull my money out, and I've opened more then 3 tickets and I still haven't gotten my money back. I hate to say this because the idea behind the app is great, but the platform is horrible."
3418,"everything's generally great, until you hit the investments. I invested about 3 times, and each time, instead of adding funds to my investment account, it went negative. every time. I had the funds available and everything. fix this, and I will fix my review, because I lost way too much money trusting this app."
3419,"I've had Qapital for three years and I never noticed that they sneakily started charging me a membership fee last November. I checked my email's clutter inbox today (because that's where their emails go, they've sent so many in the last three years) and they only sent two emails back in November to let me know they were going to start charging a fee. I'm very upset."
3420,"Was cool at first. Subscription expired and now I'm completely locked out of my money. I have to reconnect my funding account to unlock my spending card, but I cant because the brick and mortar bank account in my name doesnt even exist anymore. Cant transfer money out of the system until I reconnect a funding account, but that's right... it doesnt exist anymore and you wont help me connect my domestic partners account because it isnt in my name. Closing as soon as this is figured out."
3421,"Dismal support. Seriously. There's no phone number to call, they tell you it'll take 1-2 days for them to service a support ticket. My acct. activity says it received a deposit of $100 on 5/28. I try to withdraw $100 on 5/30 because food. Turns out there's a ~$6 brokerage fee so the withdrawal is denied by my funding acct. The $94 never made it back to Qapital. It's now 6/12. Still have not heard back from support. Shoulda planned better on my end, but 2 weeks with no answer? Not recommending"
3422,This company is terrible . I have direct deposit and they are constantly declining my card for NO reason. Then when I reach out to figure out the problem they send me to some other company Shazaam who continuously states they have ZERO to do with the decline. I can't get answers from anyone. The only option is transfer my money back to my main bank which takes days. Please don't trust this company with any significant amount of money.
3423,Came here because I read online it was free. :(. Trying to get away from digits fee but they charge even more
3424,"Never download this app they charge you to use your own money and it never let you close your account, worst app ever"
3425,Wont let me create account
3426,"This service is absolutely terrible and a scam. Not nearly one of the better apps/services to save money or invest and it's literally impossible to close your account on your own. Absolute insane process which requires you to wait for customer support to get around to you, meanwhile you're being charged while you wait. Great system🙄"
3427,"Shut my account down for no reason. After promoting them for years and having 10 of thousands of dollars saved with the app, recommend Digit instead"
3428,Poor customer service. You cannot get ahold of an actual person if an issue arises. I have been a loyal user for years but when I had an issue they have made it more difficult to get a solution and their response is just to wait days possibly a week after the initial waiting period for something that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. I have lost all confidence in their ability to handle my money and now I will have to wait a minimum of a week to be able to use or transfer it out.
3429,Gotta make an account. I wanna try it before I commit to it
3430,"They'll steal your money, and there's no way to contact them and ask them to return it. Don't use them, just put it in a savings account. Their customer service is nonexistent. And they consistently charge me $6 for...?"
3431,"I've been a user since launch in 2017. The app was great until they started making changes. I'm getting tired of dealing with the changes that keep occuring with the app. The whole point is to set it up and forget that you're saving. But It seems like every few times I open the app to see how much I've saved, I suddenly have to reconnect my account to the app and haven't had any ""activity"" in a while. This defeats the whole purpose of your app."
3432,Move on.
3433,"Will not allow me to reset password, company ignores my many emails."
3434,"I loved this app but despite reconnecting it to my bank account, it doesn't want to transfer any money. Then what am I paying for? I'm paying for my money to just sit somewhere when I could have that free. :("
3435,I heard about this app and wanted to try it to help me automate my saving. It costs $6/month to use!! This expense is much higher than my current monthly banking fees and seems extreme when the goal is to help people save money.
3436,Haven't used this app in over a year since they started having so many connection issues with my bank. Last week I withdrew some funds from my robinhood and I didn't realize that I had my qapitol account number in robinhood (I thought it was my cashapp) and it went to my Qapitol spending. I don't have a debit card and they won't let me withdraw the funds to my bank which is still listed in Qapitol as my funding account. So I have $58 in an account that I can't even access. Thanks qapitol!😤
3437,Don't expect it to be easy to cancel. I have been trying to cancel my membership for a few days and it is nearly impossible. Sure you can take away the funding account but they still have your banking information and you cannot delete your account. Definitely not worth it.
3438,Note to self: This app charges a subscription fee. You aren't interested. Stop downloading it thinking it can improve your finances. Subscriptions are drains. Bye.
3439,I used to really like this app. It helped me save a ton of money but for the past few days I kept getting the error message that Qapital couldn't be reached. Reached out to customer support and they told me I had no internet connection to the app which makes zero sense. How is Qapital the only app I have that won't connect to the internet? My bank account randomly unconnected before a day before this happened too. Too many strange connection issues. Super disappointed and uninstalled.
3440,"Can't even log in because I have a previous account with this phone number and can't remember the login info. And there's no link for help, resetting password, anything. Piss poor UI right there. Getting mad just trying to open the app is not a sign of a well designed app."
3441,"I have not been able to access my account for years and support is no help. Thank God I took my money out before this mess. The app is great, but lord forbid you run into any issues because they don't have phone support, and I reached out years ago to no avail. Thank God I took my money out, or I could have lost access to hundreds of dollars with no help on supports part on being able to get into my account. Had this issue since 2018, it's now 2021. I dodged a bullet with this app."
3442,Impossible to remove your bank account from this terrible app. Been trying for years. Customer service does nothing to help. Worst app I've ever got trapped in.
3443,"Had to order new debit card. They shut off the old one and I ordered my card on Jan. 4th, 2021. I am still waiting for it! My paycheck has been deposited to my account and I can not access my money to pay bills or anything else. New development. My paycheck goes straight to this account every month. Because my deposit happened twi minutes after my auto withdrawl of another payment they returned my payment!!! HOW STUPID. BOTH WITHDRAWAL AND DEPISIT DONE ON SAME DAY!!!"
3444,"This app has gone downhill. The day my paycheck was deposited into my account, another transaction came through and they returned the transaction! Never heard of this kind of nonsense before. I will start looking for a new app and move my money!!!!!!!"
3445,"Trying to login, it tells me it needs 2FA and to update my app but my apps already updated and theres no way to sign in to give me the code it texts me. Useless!"
3446,It keeps taking money even though I unlinked my bank and canceled the plan.... I'm tired of this
3447,Doesn't load waited 10mins wouldn't open
3448,"I've loved this app for many years, but got a new phone & trying to log back in. It's saying a 2 step authentication is now required - please update & there is no update available. Can not login to transfer my funds, contact support. Anything. There better be a way for me to get my money..."
3449,Why was $6 dollars just taken from my bank account?!?!? I don't even use this app anymore. I'm having my hard earned money get stolen from me!
3450,Legitimately terrible. No phone support is incredibly concerning since they are handling your money. The time it takes for funds to transfer and settle is ridiculous. Every other app on the planet has figured out a way to make transfers between financial institutions seamless but Qapital hasn't figured it out yet. It would take less time to walk your money to the bank a penny at a time. Don't put your money into this app. It would be better off buried in a hole in the woods.
3451,"I've been using Qapital for over two years with minimal issues. For a little while now, they lose the connection to my bank about every other week, but it's easy to restore. The connection was lost this past Sunday and it will not reconnect. I contacted support and was given instructions to fix it but it still won't reconnect. A subsequent message to support has gone unanswered. Will be transferring my savings and deleting my account."
3452,I wish I could give this app 0 stars. They stole from me for 6 months the $6 membership fee because they refused to refund me or transfer the $0.01 I had left in my account. You can't cancel a membership until your account is 0. They have no number to call for customer service so you have to wait for someone to open your message online which takes hours. This is the WORST app I have ever used I really wish I could give it 0 stars
3453,This app sucks.
3454,"Never had an issue until 5 DAYS AGO!!! They locked my account, still locked, with all of my savings and stopped responding after I provide proof of high dollar amount transactions. I've reached out on multiple platforms after them stating a 24hr response time with no response. Got a simple follow up email stating they are looking into it! I am EXTREMELY IRRITATED THAT MY ACCOUNT IS LOCKED AFTER 5 DAYS AND SHOWING PROOF THAT THE TRANSACTION ARE AUTHENTIC."
3455,"I really enjoy this app at first but it has some huge glitches that continually cause overdrafts. BEWARE!!!!!! They make it damn near impossible to change your accounts and run up service fees on old accounts. If your goal is to help your customers save why keep charging us and running up overdraft fee? Very poorly run app, and id advise using any of the other saving app. This is just a cheap knock off saving / money grab app now."
3456,update 3/10: customer service will ignore your questions if they do not know the answer. they froze my account for no reason is my assumption because they didnt reply. do not deposit large amount of money because they will lock your whole account until what they call settlement period is over. you cannot use your money even money that was available before deposit. they have no system that lets them hold only the funds that are waiting for settlement. they do not care if you have bills to pay.
3457,My experience was GREAT AT 1ST but now the app WILL NOT allow me 1.to take money from my qapital savings 2. Customer service sucks (they WILL NOT allow me to talk to a human) 3. The rules don't even work. So at the end of the day great idea POOR EXECUTION.
3458,"For your own good, don't sign up with these criminals. They'll take money from your account and you won't be able to opt out. They're criminals! Don't do it! It is scam!"
3459,It's all well and good until it doesn't pull your savings until two weeks later and then it overdrafts your bank account. Just getting a savings account from a bank. Jesus it's frustrating.
3460,Stay away from. I would really rate negative stars if able. Robinhood and similar apps are better and free. And easier to unlink bank account. This company won't allow you to remove and delete account without the run around. It is a scam. Stay away from.
3461,1 star because it is so difficult to close and delete my account. Should not be so difficult!
3462,Saved money only to have it stolen can't withdraw money capital keeps giving excuses as to why I can't get my money first account won't connect then system is down then it takes 3 weeks to Get a live rep to reply don't give capital your money
3463,Customer service has not been helpful regarding my inability to log into the app. I have made several attempts and their unhelpful response time is tremendously slow. BEWARE.
3464,The app and the website won't let me log in. I resetted my password and still doesn't work. Its been more than a week now.
3465,"They claim to have a system that prevents overdraft fees when your account is less than $100 but that's not true. When I got paid I was notified that the savings would resume and immediately after I got the notification, I transferred money to my savings so that it was less than $100. The next day they still transferred money although I had $30 in my account and charged an overdraft fee. I contacted customer service and was told there system works, it was my banks fault and would not refund."
3466,Garbage customer service. They closed my account because I asked them to hurry up and give me my money. DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT.
3467,"Bank of America not supported? Seems kind of crazy to me. Had issues for days linking my account. Once I was FINALLY redirected to Plaid, I'm informed Bank of America is not supported. Deleting the app. It's been nothing but a hassle since installing it."
3468,Heard great things about this app but the bug when attempting to link won't even let me use it. So now I have to pay 6 dollars a month for an unusable app?
3469,I just downloaded the app but when you slide the tab to link your finacial institutions it will not continue. I did click on the accept terms. Any way to get this fixed?
3470,"I tried to set up an account, the ""create account"" button just sends you to app download. It may be something I'm doing wrong, but who knows? Ya gotta let me know."
3471,It will not let you link your account! Keep stopping.
3472,"Was not able to complete set up app keep glitching out, very disappointing"
3473,The app won't even let me link my bank. Just keeps sending me in a circle. Frankly not worth the trouble when it won't even let you set up your account.
3474,"QAPITAL RECENTLY STOLE ALL MY MONEY!!!!! Beware of this app. I had an account set up, they recently did a security update and wiped my account out. I had OVER $3000 on my app account. They keep telling me there is no account using my email. No one from support@qapital is responding to any of my emails that I sent to them from my account email address. THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER TO CALL. I AM IN TEARS"
3475,Please remove the run at startup permission. Im not interested in notifications from a savings app. Only through email.
3476,Like so many others I cannot access my account. It said token expired. Reset my password. Now can't log in on app (internal server error) or web. They have my money hostage and I can't even unlink my bank account. FURIOUS. THEY HAVE STOLEN OUR HARD EARNED MONEY.
3477,I can't even access my account I want to cancel my membership and can't even do that. Very frustrating. I deleted the app and reinstalled and it's still useless.
3478,"Update: Although customer service has been in contact with me, I am not getting any closer to getting access. I was asked to provide my email address and phone number that I used to register which I did. Instead of getting access I got another requesting a picture of my driver license and upload of my bank statements connected to the account. This does not sound right and I am NOT comfortable with this request. All I need is to have access to my account. I will be filing a report with the BBB."
3479,I have not been able to sign in to my account since the update!!!!!
3480,"Liked the app, then it stopped linking with my bank account and the difficulty trying to get it fixed made me decide to just cancel. Contacted support to close the account and the steps they give don't work on app. Support can't do it/don't respond to email requests, so I'm paying a monthly fee for an app that doesn't work and I can't close. Not sure what's going on with their recent updates but I would stay far, far away and not recommend letting them anywhere near your money."
3481,Terrible!! I have no plan and the app still takes money from my account. Customer service is terrible and the people there are useless. This app is a thief and in order for it to be better it should be destroyed and built from scratch!
3482,"The app was great for managing saving goals. Although app security updates are essential, the recent update rollout has been poorly implemented. Now, I'm having issues accessing my funds. Customer support is abysmal."
3483,"Was able to save away a good deal of money with this app, then they updated their system and my phone can no longer access their server. I can't find any back up way to access my account, (everything the tells me to get the app from the play store) and they are sitting on hundreds of dollars that belong to me but I can no longer access. They have lost my trust."
3484,"I don't know why I can't log in to get my money! This is sad! What are yall doing? Had no issues for years, now I can't login!"
3485,"Extremely upset. I am trying to access my qapital account to pause the rules that are set up and I opened the app, and it's making me login again. Tried to login, nothing works. Reset my password, can't get in. Reset again, still can't get in. Tried to click on the link from the reset password email to get in contact with support, and it takes me to the login page AGAIN and I STILL CAN'T LOGIN. How am I supposed to get in contact with support about not being able to login if I can't login??"
3486,Do not use this service. I tried logging in the other day and it says I need to create an account even though I have had one for almost 2 years now. There is nowhere to log in and every time I go through the set up process all I get is a user with this phone number already exists. So I now have no access to 2 years worth of saving up and investing. I reached out to support and no response yet.
3487,I can't log in my account. I just changed my password and every time i log in it only freeze on the log in page. This is scaring me. I still have money on my account and still connected to my bank account.
3488,"App is not working, even after the update. Please fix"
3489,"Put the rating low to be seen. This app has been great up until today? It won't let me log in. Just says please wait then stops loading, like it's not even trying to let me in. Problems like this should honestly be non-existent for an all that deals with your money, I'm honestly going to have to stop using it because this is unacceptable. It's very serious when dealing with money to not let you in your account!!!!"
3490,"This banking app has been down for 2 days now. There's no blog post, email, or in app message in response to this. A quick look at Twitter reveals that basically everyone has been locked out and your keep directing them to a support email that implies that this error has to do with an individual issue opposed to your entire app not working. Imagine using qapital for your main chequing account and not being to access your money for 2 whole days. Fix it and own up to your mistakes."
3491,I have been trying to login into this app and look at my money for the past week and no luck. What's going on with the app? Why can't I log in? Is my money being stolen?
3492,"I have not had any problems until today!! I went to log in, but it asked me to update my log in...I changed my password, but now it won't let me in. It's saying ""later"", nah...I want access now!!"
3493,Started off good then the service and app functionality gets worse by the week
3494,"App updated on Jan 15th, now unable to login. Am on the newest version. Goes to login screen after my ""token"" expired and now when trying to login just stays on that screen but will flash ""please wait"" over and over when hitting login and never go anywhere. Please fix so I can access my money."
3495,"Updated the app tonight and now it won't even let me login. I hit the login button, and the screen just flashes, and stays on the same screen. Less than thrilled I can't access my money. This needs to be fixed ASAP."
3496,"8:56 PM, Jan/15, STILL NOT WORKING, VERSION UPDATED, I called at 3:20 est, left a message. I received a message stating my ""token expired"". I updated my password & a new error message ""7"" occurred, multiple times. I received a message that maybe there was fraud so I called Shazam , Qapitals' fraud department. I spoke with Shazam, no fraud. Guess what? STILL NO CALL FROM QAPITAL. I spoke to a third party that works with Qapital BEFORE I even talked to Qapital about login issue. I NEED MY $$ !!"

I am at a place of business needing to Withdraw a large amount of money And every time I log in I get a error message I have tried for over an hour to log in And now being highly embarrassed I must go home. I cannot and will not bank with a company that 1 locks your account when they want then require you to submit 5 different pieces of ID to verify it's u. Or when you log in u get error messages.
3504,"That app has forced signed me out and won't allow me to sign back in. I even went through the process of resetting my password and still am denied access due to an ""Error: 7"". When I try to contact support I get sent back to the sign in page. This is honestly ridiculous and infuriating! I want access to my money now !"
3505,"A friend sent me the referral code but I keep getting an error 7. I've reached out to support but I've not received a response, I did finally look on Facebook and saw that many users are having the same issue. Hopefully this gets resolved or I'll definitely find another app like it that isn't having so many issues."
3506,Dangerously simple. Broken in Android currently.
3507,Can somebody in customer service please help me get back into the app? It kicked me out and won't let me in despite resetting my password.

3512,"I have saved a lot of money recently with Qapital and I was happy but now I can't access my account and I know I'm putting in the correct password and login information. So all the money I saved I don't have access to. I called the Qapital Contact number but it was Money Lion. This makes me feel uneasy about putting my money with Qapital and now I can't access my accounts to get MY money! Every time I try to log in it keeps saying ""Error :7"". Please help! -Jessica Kimble"

3514,"Keep crashing, can't login"

Now im getting a error message that I tried logging in too many times and I have to try again later. When is later? I don't like not having access to my account. Up until this point I liked this app, however this has pissed me off. Once I'm able to get back into my account I'm shutting it down. Not a happy customer at all."
3516,Steals your money with no way to cancel
3517,Give me back my free master account! I've been with Qapital b4 November and I earned my free master account but now you come up with some bs to closed my account?! And when I try to reach out you completely ignore me?! Seriously fix whatever excuse you're making up and give me back my account!
3518,"I can't cancel my account. I have transferred my money back to my bank but they are still charging me a monthly fee, AND I CANT CANCEL! Do not download this app they suck and they just take your money."
3519,I have had to edit my original review after attempting to close/cancel my membership. There was no way to close the account and no assistance provided.
3520,I canceled this service almoat a year ago and it will not let me remove my acct info. I have reached out to customer service and all they say is do it through the app. I'm not using the app anymore and it is charging my acct $8 a month for nothing. It shouldntbe this hars to end service. No I have to file all these claims with my bank and have them do a stop payment. It's been over 8 months such a hassle.
3521,"Keep getting error codes on setup and customer support won't get back to me. Cannot deactivate account until I finish the setup, but it won't let me finish the setup."
