# Financial-App-Analysis

This project was initially started as an independent side project as a way for me to improve my Python abilities, and as a way for me to learn more about the financial app industry. I initially intended to scrape the Google Play store and use the resulting data set to create some basic visuals and conduct a simple statistical analysis. However, upon reviewing my data set, I discovered that it would be difficult to uncover any useful insights from the limited number of variables that I had scraped. I tried to think of other ways to make my project meaningful, which was when I came up with the idea of scraping the text from app reviews instead. With this new data set I would be able to find the popularity of specific words in reviews of different star ratings. I decided the most effective groupings would be to parse through the five star reviews and then compare my results against the one star reviews. 

After doing so, I found some interesting results. From there I used Tableau to create a simple bubble chart to help visualize the most common words. The most interesting takeaway that I noticed was how overwhelmingly often negative reviews are related to poor customer service. I expected to see a blend of negative comments about a given app's features and their customer service, but hardly any of the most common words found in one star reviews seemed related to app features. To me, my findings emphasized the importance of providing fast, reliable customer service in tandem with simple, user-friendly features when developing a personal finance app.

I drew inspiration and got my project moving with help from Venelin Valkov's article for Towards Data Science (linked for reading here):
