0,"Yeah, I really like this app, I've recommended it to friends. It's just easy, put your money in and they invest how you want and the fees are way low. I don't even use the round up feature, I just drop my paycheck in, and then I have another account for retirement that I add a small amount to weekly. Both accounts have grown way better than if the money was sitting in a savings account. Also the most important thing, to me, is you can choose to invest in ""green"" companies!"
1,Great ap for learning more and saving a little dough. Make sure you wont need the money at a moment's notice because you could end up taking a huge loss if the markets down when you have to take an unexpected withdrawal! 3.5 stars. I would give 4 but I lost nearly 12% of my total amount deposited when I sold my shares to liquidate my account in a pinch. Now that I think about it that might have been my fault. 3.7 Stars =)
2,Update: They fail at making it easy for you to close your account. Error message every hour of everyday. Signed my check overbto them and they refused to deposit into my account the same checks from social securityvthatvI WAS going yo have Direct Deposited. FORGET IT. Now im playing hell getting the little back I began depositing. ACORNS CANT BE TRUSTED. Can you say BBB Review?...Gonna paint a picture!
3,"I love the app! I've taken advantage of all they've had to offer, including the college saver! I've had to use my money a couple of times, didn't mind waiting the couple of days to recieve it, once I was able too, I started the investments over. I love watching my potential growth! I play around with the numbers all of the time! I've also, started saving $10 ( $5 into 2 diff accts) day, because of the daily compounded interest that you can earn!!"
4,Auto investing my spare change has been so simple with this app. It's actually been as easy as linking my account and going through the app to get to my online grocery shopping app. And it's really nice knowing I have a couple hundred set aside in case of emergency.
5,"So far really easy and very informative. I really like the idea of rounding up, as I just throw the change I get from spending cash in a jar at home that doesn't invest it. It just sits there in case of emergency. Thanks for being innovative Acorn Devs"
6,"I find the app easy to use, it does what it says it does. The customer service has been great to me they are very polite and answer through email really fast. If you want to withdraw you have to understand they have to sell your assets and can't do it in a snap its not possible. Any advisor is this way. I'm just sorry I didn't start using it a long time ago."
7,"I like the why it works by investing slowly over time. I don't have to really think about it. A portfolio is prepared for me. I would recommend this app everyone, because your small change becomes your investment for your future."
8,Great thing to just set and forget about. Takes the stress off investing with the market being so crazy right now. Had the app for almost a year now and they've given me a pretty consistent return and I'm very happy with it.
9,"Very clean and easy to use; nothing you don't need and everything you do. I really like Acorns. Great app to save short, medium, and long term."
10,"So far so good. Less than 2 months and I've already saved/invested more than I'd anticipated. I like the invest the change option. You don't realize how much money you spend until, in less than a week, your acorns account is $15 deeper just from your save the change contributions."
11,"Pretty good app, I've put in 350 and I've gotten a profit of 7.13 since starting in March. This app is good for all but the extreme ends of the wealth spectrum since it has a recurring investment tool so you can customize how much and when you put money in."
12,The introductory process explains a broad knowledge base simplistically. It's easy to navigate and use. The screening process is a bit tedious though(have to confirm your identityand all that.) Pretty nice and works like a savings account.
13,"Great way to invest with a little money at a time. You choose the amount down to the cent. Very nice. However, more details about what is actually being done with the money and how to use the app would be helpful."
14,"As a full-time employee and student, Acorns has been great for me. I don't have much time to focus on investing, and don't make quite enough yet to hire a financial advisor. I used to save all of my change in a jar and cash in at the end of the year. Now I put my change to work each day by using round-ups, and I'm very happy with the results so far!"
15,I love this app. The time I needed the money back I got it in less than a week. Great way to save for retirement. Its such small increments that I don't miss it. At the same time it does add up; just be consistent. Even $5 a week adds up!
16,I've really enjoyed this app as it's been one of the easiest ways for me to save money. As simple as it is I've finally been able to put aside some savings using it. I'm notoriously bad at saving money so it's been nice!
17,Have been using for over a year. Great app and way to save my spare change. I dont even miss it! Thanks Acorns for helping me grow my tree.
18,"Acorns is a terrific onramp to the world of investing. I use the Moderately Aggressive setting and have been extremely satisfied with the results. Years later, I still have my original Acorns account. I call it my ""Change Bucket"" and it continues to serve me well. Easily worth the price of admission."
19,"Love the freedom to invest and save, all with the same product. Set it to auto deposit and all I have to do is check my balances."
20,Started Acorns because I didn't know how to save or budget. Saved alot more than I figured I would with auto withdrawal. Downside it does take a few days for deposits to be put in and taken out so theirs the risk. This is for the beginner investors who know nothing about the market. Wish the fees for membership would go down also. Maybe make a minimum of what can be held in the account for a discount. Time=Money. DIVIDENDS Love them. Wonder if they still plant trees for every 1$ we put in.
21,"Love this app and the options it offers. Helps in a convienient way to save! Y'all saved the day, I had an emergency and was able to transfer funds! Amazing"
22,"I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised at how well this app is doing. I admit that I was hesitant at first, but after a co worker mention how great they are, I jumped on board and have been impressed."
23,"The Acorns app has been such a great tool for saving and growing my extra money and forgetting about. Because of this, I have been able to have emergency funds and even side money for investing."
24,"Great if your young, especially. Saving money or just budgeting with a spend account, it is the easiest way to be financially smart without even thinking about it."
25,Not bad. I didn't even noticed the difference inmy bank account and it feels like free money. Worth it to me. Already got $57.00. I'm sure it'll come in handy some day.
26,"Not bad, real simple wish I had more control over where the investments went but its a solid platform."
27,It could do better the investment charts slow lagging and you can't see what stock have gone up or down. Okay waiting for a updated interface soon...
28,I have been able to save thousands with this app in just a couple of years. Not having the money in my account and the easy round ups and other ways to deposit money make it easy!
29,Wish I had this app sooner. It's simple to setup how you want your portfolio to look and work for you
30,"This is a great app. I had my doubts initially because I like to manage my own investments, but I wanted to keep an open mind. I'm digging it! You folks do a great job of making it easy. I decided on $5 a day (with a few lump sum contributions) and taking my lunch to work oppose to buying. I also decided to use it as a ""Savings Account"" because the banks bank's interest rate is a joke. There's almost $1000 in there in just a few months! Boom Baby!!"
31,"I love the automation of this app, great for my friends and family who dont want to think about investing!"
32,"Worth it. You probably spend more spare change buying random stuff at the gas station or fast food than you would investing in this app, and it is worth it. Honestly forgot I had this and checked it recently, it's been growing! I recommend it for a long-term savings strategy. Not quick money, but totally worth it considering all the work is being done for you in the background for just spare change. Just do it."
33,"So far so good. For a 1st time invester, acorns has really made it really simple for an average joe to begin this journey. I gave it a 5 for that exact reason. Im no guru nor am technical sound when it comes to the investment world,but i am good at noticing when something feels right and suits my best interest. Its not overwhelming or confusing to manage your account. It has a really good balance with all its functions down to the companies philosophy of approach. üëç"
34,"Awesome! You'll never not know what's happening with your account. Super communication and notifications. I received my brand new ""metal"" acorns debit card with my signature embossed on it, within days! I love it. Great choice if you're looking to open a new account."
35,Easy to use. My money feels safe and I like being able to see my investments grow in relation to my active spending.
36,"Acorn app is easy to use it has a few choices for round ups 1√ó,3√ó,10√ó or you could put in a set amount.I use 3√ó round up ."
37,"Easy to use with only a marginal, barely noticable fee and great UI. I usually recommend most people starting out with a Debit card get this app, set it up, and forget it for like a month or two. Come back and ""Hey, $200!"" While being barely noticeable on statements. Its small, but adds up, and if something happens like your car breaks down like mine did, the Acorns money softens the financial blow signifigantly."
38,"Great app, you actually forget you are investing, then you look and are amazed."
39,Its been one of the best invest app along wjth a couple other not really any issue beside one i still can't get it to go pass the verify whrn i link another acount it ask for pic and i dome that but when i get to next paige it says it need acc number and stuff and when i go to submit it says having some prob try again later that it on there end or something
40,"I use it for my own personal vacation, all the money that's goes in within a year is well spent on a mini vacation, cool app. 1k+ sometimes a year depending on how much you use your Visa card"
41,"It's a solid app that invests on your behalf for the longterm, you won't be able to invest directly or daytrade. But for those of us that can't or won't save, it's a great tool. Thru either daily ATM card transactions, or anytime one time investments, or weekly,bi-weekly,monthly transactions you can save money that would otherwise be spent on Doritos and dos xx (beer)."
42,I love this app because I can invest either just my spare change or ad little ad 5 bucks a month and just leave it there are forget about it! They do all the work for me. In about 5 years I'll be very happy that I did this!! Get it done it couldn't be easier for people who want to get into stock buying but have no idea how to do it.
43,Easy way to save money. Love the app. Very customizable savings options.
44,Investing is easy with Acorns.. The round ups show you the power of your spare change. Never invested money before but you are curious what it is all about?? Acorns provides education in stocks and investing. Well written easy to understand articles explain different types of investments. The money sitting in my account provides a sense of security knowing that I am planning for my future. Get Acorns you won't be disappointed!
45,"Very easy to use. I wish my bank supported this option, but it's not the apps fault"
46,A great investment app for beginners and also a wonderful way to have some extra savings add up- emergency money!
47,"Great and easy way to save! I used this to help save money to take my family to Disney World. It took me a little bit to completely figure it out but once i did i was off to the races. Round ups are great. It rounds up every purchase to the next dollar then invests it for you. You can even set a multiplier to save faster. The only thing i wish i could do was set any multiplier i wanted. You get the choices of x2, x3 or x10. Would strongly recomend for anyone who wants to save $$$"
48,I have never used an investment app before and this app has made it so easy to navigate and round up your change to invest.
49,"I didn't start with much, still don't have alot but it's growing and hopefully I can keep it growing. All in all it a great tool, that I will use for a long time. Thank you all for your awsome app, and keep up the good work."
50,Easy to use and helps first time investors begin to understand how to manage their own money and think about their financial goals
51,Great app. I do really recommend not using too many applications that offer too many kind of Currencie transfers. It causes too many holes for your money to slip out of any accounts you have them attached to so be weary! This app does a ton. Along with monitoring all 3 major credit agencies. They are one of the best when it comes to this kind of quick application themes. Acorn üå∞. Definitely top 5 apps that do two important things that do a great job at it! Give Acorn‚Ñ¢ a try!
52,It has been really nice just having this in the background gaining some strength. Slow at first but this is one that you get back what you put in. I have a renewing investment and can just forget about it for a bit. Simple.
53,"I like it. Wish the metal card looked metal, but that's not really something to complain about."
54,"So far, so good! I just started using Acorns (about 3 months ago) after a friend told me about it. I've been happy with it so far, it's been earning me money based mostly on spare change I don't miss. The options are great too; I started accounts for my kids that'll hopefully help to get them going into adulthood. I also started a modest retirement account to supplement things later on. As long as I don't get ripped off I'll continue to be happy with Acorns!"
55,"Great for the novice investor. The app is designed beautifully and makes automatic investing incredibly accessible to newbies or those with little knowledge. I personally don't like the inconsistency of spare change investing but have my account set up for weekly deposits. You may or may not see greater gains by fully immersing yourself in the market and choosing individual stocks, but I enjoy the security and convenience that a professionally curated account has to offer. I highly recommend!"
56,Great app. Even better way to invest and save. I love the roundups!
57,Easy to use app with several ways to save money for the future. Love the roundup option.
58,This is the best application I've ever had take care of my pocket change and invested wisely with help thank you very much for making such a wonderful application.
59,Very easy to setup and very informative! Plan on using Acorn for years to come.
60,"It's a fun easy platform to use. Kind of like a game. I'm a series 7 holder and have a masters as well and I've been experimenting with all these different apps. As far as a simple, enjoyable, and educational experience goes for brand new investors who don't know a thing Bout money, you can beat it.üòÉ"
61,I really like that I can invest in environmentally sustainable companies and the round up feature is clutch!
62,"Easy to use, had it for a while, you forget it's even there and you acrue money."
63,"Very simple format, it's a roboadvising app that does most of the work with a decent amount of input from user. Have never had a problem with the app, interface, taxes, customer service. Great app!! Nothing is hidden or secret or hard to find like fine print which is nice."
64,"I really like using this app to invest. It's pretty easy, and I can quickly check in and see how my investments are doing. Update: 6/30/2021 I'm still very much a fan of Acorns and appreciate how easy it is to use it to invest."
65,Easy to use intuitive app and design. You can save/invest as little or as much as you'd like. Remember Acorns is best for long term investing so don't expect big gains in a short time. Invest wisely and always do your research if unsure about anything. The Roundup feature is quite useful as well. It definitely helps you save without thinking about it.
66,Best passive way to invest spare change. Only one small gripe. Many of the offers for extra cash via the special offers. There are some offers that are automatic. If there is any way you guys could add more I would be more willing to shop at the sponsored locations. Other than that. Roundly perfect app.
67,"It's easy to understand, easy to use and easy to add my bank accounts and do investments. It seems slow (to me at least) for the money to transfer over and become investments however I know nothing about this stuff other than what's on this app and what's been in my 401K in the past. I'm satisfied with what I see though. I feel you will be too."
68,"Great app, intuitive and easy to use and great returns on my investments so far"
69,I love the acorns app. It makes investing so easy right at your finger tips. You know everything right off hand whats going on with your money. Whether you want to go conservative or aggressive. Also it is nice to watch your money grow and grow like a flower.‚ò∫
70,"A simple and painless way to invest and save, and since the monthly fee is a flat rate, if one simply begins with a couple of thousand - or rapidly and aggressively saves up that amount - one can minimize the impact of the rather tiny fees on one's investment earning."
71,Amazing app. It's so simple and the investing spare change concept is awesome. Love the 5 simple portfolios and the ability to automatic deposits from your bank to acorns account. Everyone should have this as you are more likely to get a better rate of return than any bank nowadays
72,This app is great for those who want to invest and save money and then forget about as it grows.
73,"Wonderful way to save money, earn money, and technically be a part of the investment situation in our country."
74,"Great app for accumulating small amounts of money over time. These small contributions really can turn into a large amount of investible money. Passive savings is the way to go. If you can ratchet up the multiples in terms of what you're banking, then you really can accumulate quite quickly.I highly recommend Acorns."
75,I love using this app! It makes saving and investing painless and easy.
76,So far I like the app. You can save without even thinking about it. I have to learn more about the investment side of things. Stay tuned
77,"Great app for hands off investing and other basic banking services. The Acorns team frequently add new features, and putting your money in an ETF is by far preferable to letting it sit in your garden variety savings account. The found money system is also a pretty cool way to get cash back at places I'd normally shop anyway. If you're looking for granular control I'd probably look elsewhere, but if you'd like to keep it simple and start saving I'd definitely give Acorns a shot!"
78,I am far from a technical wizard... probably closer to a dinosaur...but I find this app was easy to set up and easy to change if needed. I've never had to contact customer support. I deposit a certain amount monthly and I tripled the spare change going into my account. Due to my age I have a moderately conservative portfolio. I have only been a member since October but I'm quite surprised actually at how my account has grown using the above methods. It's an easy way to save and not miss the mone
79,"Been using it for a while. It's nice seeing results, I'm not rich ü§ë by any means but this is another way to prepare for the future. Added this portion after a much longer period of use, I'd still recommend this as an additional way to put money away for the future, I have several savings accounts and enjoy seeing results."
80,Great functionality and a perfect way to save money.
81,"I'm happy with it. Can't say a bad thing about it. For what it is, it's done it's job flawlessly. This is not an app for the stockmarket. You cant even pick your own stocks. But for what it is; an app to quickly invest your spare change with minimal involvement, it has been great. The app has minimal options, just select your risk tolerance and let the app invest your change. I'm up 12% in 8 months and have saved almost $1,000. And I love you solid metal debit card, and for only $3 a month."
82,Easy way to save and invest. Just spend as normal and the extra change is invested.
83,I must say I loved this app but just found one for Crypto so I will be closing this app. The one I found works the same as acorns but for Crypto instead of stock.
84,I think this is a phenomenal app. It focuses on short term actions for long term solutions by rounding up change and adding up your investments in order to save for your future and all the goals you have planned. It's well developed. It's organized and the interface is really easy to navigate. Thank you.
85,"Great app, easy to use. Great way to save and invest."
86,"Started this as a ""Christmas fund"" a couple of years ago and never stopped it. I opted to not take a debit card and forgot aboht the savings. Each time I checked my account, I was blown away by how much I was saving on autopilot! Great app. üëç"
87,Best way to start saving!!! Use it as a vacation fund or set up an Ira and save for retirement. The metal card is a nice touch when you upgrade and using the acorns spend instead of a checking account helps me to just put a certain ammount of money in the spend account. A easy neat way to budget and save.
88,They could be a little faster with ACH transfers but other than that great
89,"Never an issue.. makes looking at retirement a pleasure. And the Acorns debit card is wonderful.... INSTANTANEOUS alerts in usage, is physically the most unique card in the wallet (pretty sure it doubles as a kevlar vest) and is always complimented on. Great experience!!"
90,"An awesome way for hands off investing. Just put a little money in each month and they do the rest. It's a great ""savings account"" that slowly grows without me having to constantly check it."
91,Had an issue where my I couldn't pass the 2 factor authentication after changing my phone number. I emailed them and had the whole thing resolved in less than 30 minutes! Super reliable and customer oriented bank. 10/10
92,Pretty useful. Easy to have running and forget about.
93,I had a question about the app it took a day and they were on point . I am new to saving for my future but with Acorn it's so easy they give you options. You can save as much or as little as you want!! I really like that.. I plan on being with Acorn for the long haul ...
94,"This is a great way of saving and investing. You don't have to be knowledgeable about the market to use this app. You can be as aggressive or conservative as you want. This app embodies the saying ""over time, little becomes much""."
95,"Sustainable portfolio!!! I've been using Acorns for years and have been reasonably happy with the service. Now, I'm EXTREMELY happy! I dropped my phone out of excitement when I found out I could switch from a normal investment portfolio to a sustainable portfolio! I am so happy you chose to roll this out!!!! üíöüíö‚ôªÔ∏è‚ôªÔ∏è"
96,It has been an easy way to save and invest without the worry.
97,"As someone who doesn't know to much about investing, it has been an amazing experience to see my stocks grow over time through round ups and reoccurring investments. I love the new feature to select substainable investments to invest in. Environmental issues are an area I'm trying to be more aware of. This option allows me to align my investments closer with my views."
98,Easy to use and understand. A great way to save and invest painlessly. Great features. Love the Tungsten metal Visa debit card too. Very classy in color and design.
99,"So far, this has been a great way to set aside money. This isn't my only form of savings, but I believe in multiple options. I really like the roll overs from my credit card. A few bucks a month add up, and I enjoy seeing how it grows the account while I'm not thinking about it."
100,Very easy to use. Great to keep a rainy day fund or to save for a big purchase. Only down fall is transaction times but thats out of there control and i do not fault them for that.
101,Perfect app for passive savings
102,"Not for me. This app did what it promised but there are better options. They have fixed stocks, therefore, you cannot choose which partial stocks you would like to invest in. The retirement feature they have is Acorns Later and it limits your ability to change stocks even further. They do all of the work, which maybe good for some, but not for me. Also, they don't work with many of the smaller union banks. I loss money all around plain and it's a hassle to take withdraw."
103,Great way to invest your spare change
104,Great and easy to navigate!
105,Lovely interface easy to navigate and lots of tutorials.
106,Nice
107,Acorns has been a great way to save and build investment on the side..... Love it!
108,I have No idea what I'm doing. So I hope this is right thing to do.
109,Love the app
110,A very informative investment business it's a very good and easy way to make money with people you can trust
111,Easy to use and saves money
112,Awsome
113,Started Acorns because I didn't know how to save or budget. Saved alot more than I figured I would with auto withdrawal. Downside it does take a few days for deposits to be put in and taken out so theirs the risk. This is for the beginner investors who know nothing about the market. Wish the fees for membership would go down also. Maybe make a minimum of what can be held in the account for a discount. Time=Money. DIVIDENDS Love them. Wonder if they still plant trees for every 1$ we put in.
114,I really do like this app so I'll give it all five stars
115,Love it
116,An excellent way to invest for the future. Start your children on this.
117,"I like the why it works by investing slowly over time. I don't have to really think about it. A portfolio is prepared for me. I would recommend this app everyone, because your small change becomes your investment for your future."
118,I love acorns. Referral program is awesome

121,I have saved money that I ordinarily would not have saved with Acorns.
122,good
123,Pretty easy way to build towards retirement.
124,"So far things are fine I have always wanted to be able to benefit from stocks, this gives me the opportunity to do so."
125,Excellant
126,I use it though NetSpend.
127,Easy
128,Update: They fail at making it easy for you to close your account. Error message every hour of everyday. Signed my check overbto them and they refused to deposit into my account the same checks from social securityvthatvI WAS going yo have Direct Deposited. FORGET IT. Now im playing hell getting the little back I began depositing. ACORNS CANT BE TRUSTED. Can you say BBB Review?...Gonna paint a picture!
129,Beautiful surprises. I leave it alone and it earns money. Couldn't ask for better.
130,Excellent.....

146,Turned out to be better than I thought!!
147,They are the best

174,This app is great for those who want to invest and save money and then forget about as it grows.
175,Got that 1G for just inviting 4 friends. Thank you Acorns!!!!!!
176,"Acorns is a terrific onramp to the world of investing. I use the Moderately Aggressive setting and have been extremely satisfied with the results. Years later, I still have my original Acorns account. I call it my ""Change Bucket"" and it continues to serve me well. Easily worth the price of admission."

178,"So far really easy and very informative. I really like the idea of rounding up, as I just throw the change I get from spending cash in a jar at home that doesn't invest it. It just sits there in case of emergency. Thanks for being innovative Acorn Devs"

200,"I've been using Mint since 2010. Over the years it has consistently improved everything. Now, it's hard to imagine the mobile version being any better, but I'm sure mint will improve upon it even more. I have tried other budgeting apps but nothing comes close to Mint. Sometimes one of your financial accounts may change something on their website and you'll have trouble connecting it to Mint but that is just a fact of life. Mint has always worked tirelessly to solve and correct such issues."
201,I used this as my first budgeting app and it is amazing! I've tracked my college expense s on it and it's made my life so much easier. The design of the app is simple and easy to navigate. I do wish there were less advertisements for credit cards but other than that the app is great!
202,"Add subscription as a budget category.. People usually have several. Make the app recognize repeat expenses so we don't have to recategorize each month. Also, when looking at spending for the month, how about grouping expenses like ""fast food"" ""store"" ""restaurant"" ""unknown"" I have several taco bell and Costco trips, if they were grouped it would give me a better at a glance feel of my spending."
203,Really clean interface and shows a great break down of where all of your money is. I would highly recommend. I don't use this as a banking app or investment app but it connects everything and shows me where my money is or went so I go here first to look at things.
204,Great app for keeping track of all your accounts and spending in one easy place. Makes personal accounting so easy and trackable. Makes it easier to save money and cut out or flag unnecessary expenses or mistakes in your accounts.
205,I love this App! Most of my accounts synced really easy and the few debts I couldn't sync I just added as properties and updated manually. view the trends for Net income and net worth are great motivators to eliminating debt. Budget tracking is 4/5 stars. Highly recommend for anyone!
206,I was just thinking today how having used Mint over a decade or more has helped me save a tremendous amount by allowing me to track easily a multitude of credit cards and bank accounts I keep openimg in a pursuit of best rates and rewards. And I rarely if ever have technical trouble with the app. So thank you Mint!
207,"12/2/2019 I love being able to check everything in one glance üëç 7/9/2022 still loving it - especially the widget showing all accounts and balances. Oh, and the net worth. Satisfying to see that number as I make progress in paying off my debts. üòé And slowly getting back to black üë©üèº‚Äçüé§"
208,I guess you could say I'm a promoter for Mint...well all Intuit apps really. My life has gotten significantly easier when it comes to financing and being responsible. Always has been super easy to use. Great app.
209,Makes it easy to see everything at a glance. Some more options for graphs in the app would be nice but it's very helpful for getting a quick picture of finances.
210,"I have used a few premium budget apps. So far Mint is the best, and I can't believe it is free. Love the quick transactions update from banks. The search and auto categorizing are impressive too."
211,"It's a great way to keep up to date with your credit as well as your spending so you can make adjustments on just about anything, super useful and friendly user interface!"
212,There are more features on the website that can be added to the app but overall great app to track spending and budget appropriately!
213,"A great tool for budgeting and monitoring expenses. It has a few things it can't do via the app, but it seamlessly integrates with the desktop version."
214,"I really like this app. I was hesitant to join because of all the info you input, but my credit score has gone up so much based on their recommendations. I definitely recommend this app to everyone!"
215,"Been using mint for years, recent updates to app a welcome change. Best tool to have the insight you need of your spending and balances to improve or maintain your financial health."
216,Best free app. Works well and helps me to get a full picture of my fiances with no effort on my part. Love it.
217,The new update is really great the UI is also easy and friendly to use. They support a lot of banks and a lot of investment account s including coinbase for Bitcoin.
218,"Very useful, gives me peace of mind seeing my credit score whenever I want and definitely helps keep track of my money and accounts."
219,"Stopped working on Android 12. Come on now. Update: No, did that. All Quicken apps broke on Android 12. Again, fix."

221,Very user friendly app. You can see your whole budget at a glace in the monthly tab which is so helpful.
222,"Pretty good app, i like that you can keep track of all your spending and see where your money goes"
223,"I've been using mint for a couple years now, and having a widget on my phone's homescreen has done wonders to stay informed of my finances, and bring it back to a very healthy place. It's become an addiction to check the app daily, but perhaps one of the few to have a positive benefit."
224,AMAZING app with many opportunities for growth and learning more about your own personal finances.
225,"To be honest, I think I would be spending hours trying to understand my finances. Because of Mint, it does most of the work for me and keeps me on track."
226,This give a great view of your money and you can see what you can do with extra or whatever it is great!
227,This app has really been a life safer for me! I check it everyday. I am much more conscious about my spending habits and my credit score.
228,"I started using Mint (through the Website) 15-months ago and really appreciate having it. Mint allows you to keep track of all of your financial accounts, bills, assets and budget in one location. It auto updates daily. Also, it allows you to set and track goals such as paying off credit cards. These are just some of the things in a nutshell Mint offers. I highly recommend using Mint."
229,"Intuitive app that's great for monitoring your financials. You can connect bank accounts, investments, bills, and property. This app is great for tracking net worth, cash flow, and budgets. Close integration with Intuit TurboTax is also a very nice feature."
230,üíØ% helpful perfect app to help you keep your finances in order and helps you keep track.
231,"Getting this app to connect to my bank accounts was a pain. Edit: They have improved, or become more known if the banks were in the wrong. This app changed my financial habits. Knowing is half the battle, and the graph of my food expenses growing for food I did not remember along with the net income chart caused me to examine my financial habits. They integrate all the information so well, your get a whole picture of where your money, and to an extent your life, is going."
232,"I got this app hoping it would help me understand finances a little bit better. I'm blown away... Not only have they accomplished that, but I am actually interested in learning more! Way to make saving money easy to understand and also interesting!"
233,"Definitely worth the download, especially for those with multiple credit cards you know longer have to login multiple accounts every month to see what is due when. Login once with Mint and easily track your network, monthly subscriptions, debt to income, you can even make a budget and track it. If you use turbo tax you can also track your refund! It's the real deal so ignore low star reviews if there is any. They constantly put out updates as well!"
234,"Great app! I used to have some issues with accounts disconnecting, but that seems to be a problem of the past. Very customizable which I like. It definitely helps when you forget to go over your budget until the end of the month, because everything is recorded and organized for you. This app does a really good job of what many other services are charging for."
235,Very easy to use and a great way to track all my spending and bills!
236,"It's really easy to use and it is teaching me with actions to maintain a healthy credit. I heard from this app in The Financial Diet (youtube) a couple of years ago, only now I started to actively use it and it's great. I'm 22 but I wish I took this seriously when I started working at 18."
237,"I used to really love this app. But lately, the information it's showing isn't up to date. The last thing it's showing me is from nearly a month ago. I've ensured that my accounts are connected but idk. It just won't update properly. Kinda hard to use when it won't show you this month's information."
238,Mint is exceeding my expectations . Its great to see all my account activities congregated in one place. Makes life so much easier. Accounts have stayed connected to Mint. Info is always correct and in real time. No need to connect to each accounts app except to pay balances. All my checking account activity from all my different banks are in one simple view. Try this out if you want to make your financial life into a wonderment of joy and happiness.
239,Great options for budgeting and keeping track of your credit score. Easy and convenient.
240,Overall this is a solid app. It provides fast and convenient access to all your linked accounts in one place. The online chat is actually quite helpful; I had inadvertently added an account twice. The only thing I miss now is a way to download the numbers to Excel for year-end and tax time analysis.
241,I've been using mint for a long time and it has gotten better with a lot of useful information on my money accounts.
242,Mint is amazing. It helps me keeo on track with my budget and spending automatically. It gives me tips on improving my credit score that work. I've increased my score my over 40 points in 3 months. It's a great app for keeping track of my entire financial life and now I can't live without it.
243,"Feature-rich Mint has made it much easier to keep track of our spending in various categories. Can't believe it's free! Searching all transactions by various keywords is powerful. I ran 4 different businesses last year, and being able to get summarized data for each business made tax time infinitely easier. Other favorite features include seeing our net worth at a glance and viewing a variety of reports to understand trends in our income, expenses, and much more. Very user-friendly!"
244,"Love the App, it's great to monitor your expenses and spending."
245,I'm not really good at adult stuff like saving money or credit scores or remembering to make dinner before 11 pm on a Tuesday. But this app has helped me be better at remembering that credit scores exist and I should care about them. And actually save some of the money I get. Doesn't help remind me about dinner though....
246,Amazing workhorse for a one stop for personal finance management. Seamlessly connects to various accounts.
247,UPDATE: The revisions to the app are nice and make it easier to organize info and give it a nice look. GREAT way to keep track of what I am spending money on - and all in one place. I especially love the ability to easily see how much money I have left to save every month. The amount of functionality for free is incredible.
248,"Use it weekly if not daily. I have many accounts across multiple banks and financial institutions so it is a lifesaver for keeping track of cash flows, budgets, etc. A bit too many ""personalized offers"" (ads) for my taste, but they have to make money too so it's fine. Certainly not intolerable and no pay walls or things dominating the actually useful information, plus they are all money focused offers so I'm not getting spam ads or anything like that. Overall 5 stars"
249,Love this app. The budgeting feature is so helpful... it's been making budgeting really easy to do and almost fun if budgeting can be fun! I love the fact it allows you to make financial goals and that it keeps track of your credit score. It also can help remind you of upcoming bills. 5/5
250,"Wow, just wow. Connected all my accounts easily and with no hassel. Checks my investments and tells me my net worth. Amazing app. Love it, Never have had any bugs or glitches. When I refresh all accounts are properly updated and can see all funds through all accounts."
251,"Great app for personal finance management and budgeting. The mobile app is not as feature rich as the website though. It's good for quick actions, but I prefer the web version to do most of the budgeting."
252,"You can keep track of multiple bank accounts, credit card apps and bill information all in one place. Its convenient, you can budget your spending, manage paying off bills and see your credit score. Very helpful."
253,Love this app! User friendly and love the result graphs and tables.
254,"Clean and efficient money tracking app. You truly get out what you put in. From credit cards, to investments, it's good to have a round up of everything all in one place. Only downside is the update lag but it by no means takes away from the experience."
255,"Like many couples, my husband and I have a lot of separate but joint accounts. It is much harder to keep on budget and track progress on financial goals with so many accounts and bills these days, but mint has helped us tremendously. I recommend it to everyone who talks about trying to stay on budget or spouses that struggle managing separate accounts. There is just so many tools built in, even if you don't use all of them, being able to see where money is being spent can be so helpful."
256,"AMAZING app!!!!! It's gives me extremely important information, at my finger tips, about my spending, that I wouldn't have known, without crunching numbers for hours!! It's truly incredible!!"
257,"I love connecting my accounts and seeing all of my balances at once. Also it's nice that all of my transactions are visible by category. And, I like the ability to create my own categories and modify transactions accordingly."
258,"I'm new to mint, recommended by my family. I enjoy the ease at which you can navigate."
259,"Really helpful to keep track of expenses and net worth. It is an easy way to look at your income and expenses over multiple checking, savings, investment and credit card accounts."

261,"Great app for tracking all of your accounts, cash flow, and credit score. It has some basic budget-making capability that is low maintenance but not too extensive."
262,What an amazing experience. Easy to use easy to navigate and easy to understand. Thanks so much!
263,"Latest update is great. It does seem to be a little ""buggy"", but a reinstall seems to correct it. I wish you could select specific date ranges. Maybe in the future. Keep up the good work."
264,"Overall this app is great. I do wish there were a few more ways to customize, but it makes budgeting very convenient. I have tried many different budgets and this is the only one that I have been able to follow for an extended period of time."
265,"If I hadn't downloaded this app it would have taken me a double the time, if not more, to increase my credit score. This budgeting app helped me pinpoint where to start and explained how to fix it. Sometimes good things in life can be free. üòä üëç"
266,"It's not perfect but it work's great for our purposes. Please release an update for the Andriod app. -double counting transactions -miscatgorization -other bug fixes. Thank you for maintaining the app and providing updates, it makes a huge difference."
267,The best financial aggregation app I have used. Easy to evaluate spending and investment trends.
268,"This app is really good, I would use it everyday. Right now I wish Robinhood would accept 3rd party apps. Edit: Robinhood works perfectly with Mint now, thank you. Plus the UI looks a lot better with the new update."
269,So great. Love this app. Super useful and convenient. Very user friendly. Access everything in one place? Too easy! Love it.
270,"App features are minimal compared to web based platform. Web based platform is relatively easy to use, though can be confusing to learn at first. Lots of useful features and recommend everyone to use it."
271,Love that you can connect all investments and banks in one place. There are a few bills that I couldn't connect. I Would like to see an option for percentage budgeting based on your income.
272,Really like it. Very helpful. And it helps me keep a handle on my finances. I especially like the feature where it tells you what your subscriptions and bills are.
273,Easy to use and very helpful to see my finances and credit in one place.
274,I absolutely love this App! Between Turbotax & Mint.... These 2 Apps have made things from my taxes to my @ home online business soooo much easier!! I would highly recommend this App because you're going to love 'em!!
275,Great app! Making the complexity of monitoring finances simple
276,"The recent UI refresh is just awesome, especially the full screen graphs. I've been using Mint for 10 years or so and I've never seen it like this. Keep up the good work."
277,"Very easy to navigate , you can get the info you need to keep your spending undercontrol. Is amazing to see how you spend money..and you forget."

281,"Love this app! The only thing I'd like to see is the tablet experience to be similar to the phone experience. The tablet version seems like it hasn't caught up to the phone version for some time and with the new UI on the phone, I'd like to see the tablet version also update to the new UI. Very useful app overall!"
282,"Excellent App. If you are OCD about the management of your money and the ways you allocate it, expend it or save it... This is the app to have on the palm of your hands."

284,Excellent tracking tool for expenses and investments.
285,"The first step in stopping any $$ problem is knowing how much income to debt ratio you have. Duh. Mint allows me to see ALL of my accounts in one place, that alone is worth the time to download it to me. üëç"
286,"Great app!l and easy to use! With all my finances in different spots, this app brings that all together in one easy to read place."
287,"Mint does all the work for you! No more trying to figure it out on my own, I just click the tabs and review the stats! Amazing! Super easy to use app with great feedback/ support."
288,Great app for the android platform and best part is it's free! Fairly easy to keep track of projected estimates.
289,"Very easy and convenient. It make the job of tracking all my accounts so much easier, and all in one place."
290,Mint has a very enjoyable and clean look and interface. The automatic purchase tracking and deducting makes it a no brained. Let's not forget it's also completely free!

297,Stellar app to help with budgeting and finance. Seeing all my transactions for the month in handy categories makes tracking my spending easy. Only downside is I need to re-link my accounts more often than I'd like.
298,Mint has been amazing in keeping me informed about my credit score and showing me way's to raise it. They have a host of information to help you with anything pertaining to your money issues. Mint monitors your score for you for free unlike so many others. You can pay bills through them as well. Not sure how they can do all these things for free but I'm very happy they can. Mint has helped me immensely. Thank you Mint for all your help. Sincerely Elizabeth R

300,Very user-friendly
301,"Once you get the ball rolling on this, it's an extremely valuable tool. The phone app is great, but the website is most useful.

391,This app has really been a life safer for me! I check it everyday. I am much more conscious about my spending habits and my credit score.
392,Great app to monitor spending
393,This give a great view of your money and you can see what you can do with extra or whatever it is great!
394,"I really like this app. I was hesitant to join because of all the info you input, but my credit score has gone up so much based on their recommendations. I definitely recommend this app to everyone!"
395,There are more features on the website that can be added to the app but overall great app to track spending and budget appropriately!
396,For me Mint is way better than Personal Capital.
397,Best free app. Works well and helps me to get a full picture of my fiances with no effort on my part. Love it.
398,This is a great app to follow you money!!
399,Excellent program to keep an eye on everything
400,Great app for tracking personal financials. We used Quicken for years and years but were disappointed with interface performance and tech support after it left the Intuit Suite. We tried Mint for awhile but found Personal Capital and decided to test it out. We've been very pleased with its performance over the past year and half and have recommended it to family and friends. :)
401,"Awesome app. The constant nagging and advertising for money manager meetings and related products is annoying. I would happily pay to avoid this constant barrage of advertising. That said, I am open to signing up for products that I want to have offered like a personal loan, Credit card offer etc. Business model for this is not great for users who are DIY, but the app is awesome!!! Hence 5 stars."
402,"I recommend this app to everybody. Staying on top of personal finance has never been easier. Being able to split transactions is a fantastic add. And the crypto function had been a nice addition as well. I love being able to sign in and see all my finances in one, easy to digest place."
403,"Superb. The dark mode alone puts it above Mint for me, but the cleaner design, more accurate transaction categorizing, and far fewer ads make it the clear winner for me."
404,"Connects more accounts than Mint and has less ads. Doesn't have hardly any budgeting features, but I don't budget per se anymore, I just keep track of my cash, transactions, investments and assets. And I LOVE the retirement planning feature."
405,I check this app every day. It has helped me get a good understanding of where I am at financially and allows me to keep track of all my accounts in one place. Highly recommend for anybody who is trying to get a better understanding of their current financial situation and spending habits.
406,"Great tool which shows total assets and liabilities, cash flow, and likelihood of achieving financial retirement goals, plus more."
407,"This is a great app, I look at it way too often. Well organized, excellent tools and lenses through which to consider your finances and plan for retirement."
408,"Great app, it has the best financial dashboard I've seen. Their retirement planner and other tools are awesome too. All for free!"
409,"I use this app at least once a week, it's such a great tool. Target to pay bills, and continue on the investment journey."
410,"Great app!! Easy to use and to track spending, budget, investments, and net worth."
411,One of the best financial apps to track individual portfolio. Also helpful to track spending.
412,Love this app keeps me track of all my income and expenses in every detail possible. All for free!
413,Seems to track very well of my accounts so far. Hopefully won't get the same issues I had with Mint and having to reverify my accounts.
414,This app is great to keep track of multiple accounts with different banks and investments. I can categorize everything and see my monthly spending. It's really helped me!
415,This App & Personal Capital itself are both doing great for me. The App allows me to see & analyze my finances & investments w/all entities I allow it to see & helps me make financial decisions. Their asset mgmt has outperformed Fidelity's Advisors for me. Recommend highly.
416,This app is amazing for those seeking to get control and manage your accounts and portfolio's looking forward to making our retirement work for us.
417,Great app- easy to navigate and see your financial snapshot all in one place
418,I enjoy using Personal Capital to continually analyze & manage my personal finances. Many useful tools.
419,Great app. Nice to see the financial information in consolidated one place for wholistic view.
420,Been using this app and the website for over a year tackling financial goals. Great app.
421,Great for tracking monthly cash flow and net worth
422,Better format than mint. Updates more quickly. Easier to use.
423,Easy to set up. Shows your whole up to date financial picture.
424,"Easy to use, great platform"
425,Useful for pulling accounts together in one view.
426,Great app. Been using it for 4 years
427,"Great app to keep track of your finances. 5/5 Edit: Over time, more and more of my accounts have succumbed to syncing problems. First it was the 401k, and now it's Chase credit cards. I've heard of other people with the same issues. Might give Mint a try. üòï 3/5 Update (11/11/20): Chase is syncing again, but 401k still has issues. 4/5 Update (04/05/2021): 401k syncing again! 5/5!"
428,So helpful for staying on track financially.
429,Love this app from visually seeing my net worth grow to seeing how much I've spent in any store from any account great app. What I think would be interesting would be a text alert for spending budget. I.E 250 limit for groceries and the app would send a text alert to let me know I am close to the limit.
430,Love the way it tracks monthly cash flow
431,I like seeing the graphs for each account. For the most part everything updates on its own too. Some bank accounts require additional authentication. Great way to watch your net worth ü™¥ growing.
432,"Comprehensive accounting of personal finances, retirement, cashflow. Some accounts with two-factor authentication interfere with synching by adding an unnecessary dialog that has to be acknowledged by the user after the second factor is entered. This isn't the app's fault, but it is possible to program around this by adding a user acknowledgement step. Recommended by the brilliant analyst Lyn Alden Schwartzer."
433,"Excellent App and Platform!!! The only budgeting and financial system that allows you to link the value of your home into the net worth! I also appreciate the ability to create budget groups and name them, which allows me to link any transaction from any account that I have imported, to a budget. Overall clean, organized and most importantly accurate."
434,Great application! I understand that it takes a little time to switch over to the new protocol when one of the linked apps changes something about how they want people to log in. The fact is that if more people used a authenticator app they wouldn't have those issues. How long before the crypto tracking is out of beta? Can't wait to be able to change the entry price. ü§ëü§ë
435,"Been accessing PC for several years as a quick review of assets.. and spending, if desired. The display organizes accounts...from one.s various income to a portfolio: %.s of holdings, classifications of assets, and assorted visual charts.. all give an instant, comprehensive view of the Portfolio. Whether you are managing a household budget..or, a growing portfolio in the markets, the algorithms keep on top of valuations. And, it.s all easy to set up..and get started! mbnJ"
436,Very easy to add accounts. Data display is clear and organized. There's a lot of helpful functionality.
437,A very good app to track your networth.

439,So useful and easy to use
440,"Nice app for accessing accounts from banks, brokers and having all the information in a single place. It also saves historic data so you can see how your investments or bank accounts evolve through time."
441,Great app and a great company. Very useful tools for budgeting and wealth management.
442,"Great way to track all accounts. However, Zillow stopped working so house is not included anymore. Any reason why?"
443,"Best free finance tracker I've found so far, but I do wish the interface was more modern, and I'd happily pay a premium subscription to get rid of the ads for the parent company."
444,"Excellent at showing helpful info from multiple financial institutions: current balances, historical transactions. I can customize how info is displayed and the naming/tagging of each accounts. It's A.I. that dissects my portfolio and recommends adjustments is insightful."
445,This app completes the desktop option very well. Perfect to have a centralized view of all your accounts and assets in one place with budgeting and performance tracking on top of it. Really the best i tried so far
446,Thanks for adding One Year in Date Range. That is really helpful and shows you pay attention to details. Keep up the good work.
447,"Personal Capital is an awesome app if you take the time to understand the tools, trend account history, and build financial plans. They are powerful tools that the help build investment strategies."
448,"So far so Good! Great app! Helps you with your investments giving you tips, advice and se every account in one place!"

464,"Great for tracking finances, and the support is very helpful."
465,"Best place to keep all of your finances. Especially if you've got multiple accounts that change values such as 401(k), HSA, personal brokerage account, mutual funds, etc."
466,Excellent app! Great way to manage finances and prepare for retirement.
467,Really like the apps organization and usefulness to see all investments in one place as well as the tools
468,Like the app overall so far. Would be good to have a YTD filter/view for all listed assets across linked accounts.
469,"Smooth platform for both mobile and PC, all my accounts linked up easily and quickly."
470,"Easy to use, slices and dices your finances into useful views."
471,Fantastic app. Easy to setup and use!
472,"Like Mint, but with better long-term tracking."

488,Great place to see everything in one place.
489,Simple easy great service
490,"A great comprehensive app for tracking finances and linking accounts. Refreshes are pretty fast. I love that it includes zestimates of home values. Only complaint is that transactions don't autocategorize, so I have to edit them manually. Other than that, it's a solid, dependable, straight forward app that does what it says it does! Definitely better than Mint!"
491,I love the app. It's super easy to use
492,The app is soooo useful!!
493,Best personal fiance software on the market
494,Great consolidation of assets
495,Very good indeed üëç‚ò∫Ô∏è. All smiles from me.
496,One of the best apps to agregate multiple accounts to give you a current snapshot of all your assets. But it keeps a history too. Many other features and customer service that responds.
497,"I feel bad. I originally voiced my issue on this public forum, when I should have tried support first. Personal Capital responded and asked if I could enter a support ticket. I did, and my issue is being handled. Imagine that. I regret my former review and want to make clear that I find this app really useful. I'm very happy with it and hope I didn't cause any damage. To me, it does Mint better and less invasively."
498,"at first glance, it looks simple/basic; that's what it turns out to be, data driven and no frills! i can view all the accounts with each of their breakdowns by scrolling down the screen. it's also one of the most accurate apps to extract transaction names (least amount of work for me to rename them, while still an option). compared to some other free apps with tons of distracting paid content/advertising, this is a breath of fresh air! (only complaint is that it doesn't budget)"
499,"I love this app, the layout is clean and it is useful to have all of my accounts visible in one place. I even like the budgeting info they have better than Mint. One negative is that PC can take a minute to load account info with each new login, but this isn't a big deal. Definitely recommend for people looking to organize their finances into a single, global view!"
500,Easy to use and loaded with excellent information. Everything I need to manage my planning in a clear and concise interface.
501,Best personal fiance software on the market
502,Its pretty good. Haven't faced any major issues yet

590,Excellent retirement calculator
591,Absolute best finance software ever.
592,"Great app. Simple, functional and fast. Just how I like it. Love it!"
593,So far so good
594,It vorks!
595,"Great app to keep track of your finances. 5/5 Edit: Over time, more and more of my accounts have succumbed to syncing problems. First it was the 401k, and now it's Chase credit cards. I've heard of other people with the same issues. Might give Mint a try. üòï 3/5 Update (11/11/20): Chase is syncing again, but 401k still has issues. 4/5 Update (04/05/2021): 401k syncing again! 5/5!"
596,So far so good
597,Love this app from visually seeing my net worth grow to seeing how much I've spent in any store from any account great app. What I think would be interesting would be a text alert for spending budget. I.E 250 limit for groceries and the app would send a text alert to let me know I am close to the limit.
598,"So far so Good! Great app! Helps you with your investments giving you tips, advice and se every account in one place!"
599,Keeps me up on my financial out as well as my investments.
600,"I've only been using this app for a little over a month and I love it. It's much easier to set up the first time on a computer, but once you do it's fantastic. All the features and analytics I wanted fron PocketGuard but never got. I would highly recommend this app if you are interested in taking control of your finances all in one place. Extremely easy to set up, link your accounts, and tweak the settings from your computer or phone."
601,Easy to set up and use. Subscription required but then no ads.
602,I love the app and all of my accounts were able to be connected.
603,This app works tons better than the Quicken full windows app.
604,"Fast, Efficient, clear nice menu."
605,"I have to say, finally everything I hoped for from quicken. Support, top notch! Paco is the man. Software works excellent on a desktop browser and the app. Worth the money! Best financial app in my opinion"
606,It's fun to customize and see all your money on an app you can review whenever you want!
607,Combination to define
608,"I've liked it a lot so far. No real major complaints and the only account it currently doesn't sync with is Robinhood. Otherwise, I love that they have an attachment feature that I can upload receipts to. It seems like finance apps are either ""budgeting"" (no receipts) or ""expenses"" (but no budgeting), and this seems to fit nicely in between for my needs. Reporting is clean and manageable, updates are quick and there do not seem to be any issues connecting with my banks."
609,"Finally, Quicken! It's a beta, but I love it so far. For all those giving one star, this is not Quicken or Mint, this is a separate service in beta. They definitely could have communicated that better on the app description. It's much better than mint right out of the box. It can connect to some services I can't in Mint. The best part is that I can upload receipts and PDFs!"
610,"I've tried so many budgeting apps. They all suck for one reason or another. A big problem is syncing reliably with your financial institutions. Another problem is limited budgeting customization. I could list several other problems, but the point is that Simplifi solves them all, and it's 4 bucks per month. I tried hard to think of a criticism. I thought of one: I wish they had a dark theme for the phone app and the desktop version. Other than that, I love it."
611,"Pleasantly surprised. I got to say that I think Simplifi's interface is infinitely cleaner and easier to use than Mint'd. It's much easier to select categories and the ability to automatically classify like transactions in the same category is very helpful, as is having the tag feature when you want an additional level of detail. The reports feature covers pretty much anything you would want. Yeah, it's not free, but if you want better tracking, it is better than Mint."
612,"This app is very useful, especially if you have lot different banks and saving account to keep track on... im actually was surprise how many useful features, such as making saving goalsüíµ, shows me my top spending graph üò±üí∏, how to reduce my financial spending and so much more. Plus, the pricing for premium isnt ridiculously expensive, so far its worth it, I really recommend this app."
613,"I actually lucked into this. I have an ancient version of Quicken (2007?) on a desktop I'm trying to phase out. Found this. I was looking to see if Quicken could work on a Chromebook or if I could link to an app. This cloud/web-based option seemed best. I trust the name. I figured on not using my old Quicken data, so I don't mind that it doesn't link. Super easy setup. App is easier to navigate than what I saw on a browser. Love that you can turn on TouchID. So far, so great!"
614,"It's a complete solution. Pulls all your accounts in one place. Tracks all your bills, even the annual ones. Calenders your pay and bills so you can see your estimated balance on any given day. You can set lots of savings goals to one account, so you don't have to open different savings accounts for each saving goal. I recommend this app. Has lots of features but the layout is simple and easy to read."
615,"Finally, a simple and efficient tool for budgeting and reporting personal finances."
616,"By far, the most transparent and intuitive money management software I've used. A bargain."
617,"While not perfect, this app has the best potential by far out of all the personal finance apps I've explored. Really like it's past insights, spending watchlist, and the future projections it gives you to plan ahead."
618,"This app gets a lot of flak for its' lack of unique features but I find nothing to complain about. As an accountant, this gives me all I care about in a simple, elegant interface."
619,Better then ynab and mint with a very smooth interface. A big factor to my love for this is there are no ads. I'd rather pay then get ads.
620,"I love how simple and effective this app is--I can see everything at a glance, it tells me what to expect without having to search for it."
621,Great experience so far ! Support is very responsive. there is a lot of room for enhancements but a great start.
622,Easy to use
623,Love it because it's easy to see all budget monthly and help us to understand how our money travel
624,I need to get my financial info in one place. I used Yodlee before Toshl. I have a don't mind changing expense categories. Manual expense is stone age. Easy to follow graphs and clear graphics has won me over.
625,I've tried a whole bunch of budgeting apps but none had what I was looking forward except for this one.
626,Does a great job with investments! It even picks up my 401k account. It is the easiest way to keep an eye on how things are going.
627,Very impressed so far! Incredibly good UI and packed with great features
628,"This app revealed the damage uber, doordash and starbucks have done to my wallet. By taking advantage of Simplifi's spending insights, my salary has effectively doubled."
629,This program is terrible. Nothing but problems. Will not renew. Finslly got refund.
630,Easy use and customizable. üòÄ
631,Excellent recurring bills tracking and cash flow charts
632,Good work recommend for Google store android

634,Finacial freedom but secure. Budget budget save
635,I love this app so very interesting!
636,Great app to track your finances
637,"Love this app, just what I've been looking for."

685,"Fast, Efficient, clear nice menu."
686,"I've only been using this app for a little over a month and I love it. It's much easier to set up the first time on a computer, but once you do it's fantastic. All the features and analytics I wanted fron PocketGuard but never got. I would highly recommend this app if you are interested in taking control of your finances all in one place. Extremely easy to set up, link your accounts, and tweak the settings from your computer or phone."
687,It's fun to customize and see all your money on an app you can review whenever you want!

691,Great
692,Works well.
693,"I have to say, finally everything I hoped for from quicken. Support, top notch! Paco is the man. Software works excellent on a desktop browser and the app. Worth the money! Best financial app in my opinion"
694,Awesome app
695,"Finally, a simple and efficient tool for budgeting and reporting personal finances."
696,Try it for your self
697,"I've liked it a lot so far. No real major complaints and the only account it currently doesn't sync with is Robinhood. Otherwise, I love that they have an attachment feature that I can upload receipts to. It seems like finance apps are either ""budgeting"" (no receipts) or ""expenses"" (but no budgeting), and this seems to fit nicely in between for my needs. Reporting is clean and manageable, updates are quick and there do not seem to be any issues connecting with my banks."
698,"It's a complete solution. Pulls all your accounts in one place. Tracks all your bills, even the annual ones. Calenders your pay and bills so you can see your estimated balance on any given day. You can set lots of savings goals to one account, so you don't have to open different savings accounts for each saving goal. I recommend this app. Has lots of features but the layout is simple and easy to read."
699,Finacial freedom but secure. Budget budget save
700,Great experience so far ! Support is very responsive. there is a lot of room for enhancements but a great start.

705,MUCH better than Personal Capital for expense tracking!!!
706,Very good.please Try it would be good.
707,"I've tried so many budgeting apps. They all suck for one reason or another. A big problem is syncing reliably with your financial institutions. Another problem is limited budgeting customization. I could list several other problems, but the point is that Simplifi solves them all, and it's 4 bucks per month. I tried hard to think of a criticism. I thought of one: I wish they had a dark theme for the phone app and the desktop version. Other than that, I love it."
708,Better then ynab and mint with a very smooth interface. A big factor to my love for this is there are no ads. I'd rather pay then get ads.

722,"Pleasantly surprised. I got to say that I think Simplifi's interface is infinitely cleaner and easier to use than Mint'd. It's much easier to select categories and the ability to automatically classify like transactions in the same category is very helpful, as is having the tag feature when you want an additional level of detail. The reports feature covers pretty much anything you would want. Yeah, it's not free, but if you want better tracking, it is better than Mint."

Plus, the pricing for premium isnt ridiculously expensive, so far its worth it, I really recommend this app."
742,üëç
743,Boa wmf
744,"I love how simple and effective this app is--I can see everything at a glance, it tells me what to expect without having to search for it."
745,"A breeze to use! And FUN, too!"
746,Does a great job with investments! It even picks up my 401k account. It is the easiest way to keep an eye on how things are going.
747,"While not perfect, this app has the best potential by far out of all the personal finance apps I've explored. Really like it's past insights, spending watchlist, and the future projections it gives you to plan ahead."
748,"This app revealed the damage uber, doordash and starbucks have done to my wallet. By taking advantage of Simplifi's spending insights, my salary has effectively doubled."
749,"I actually lucked into this. I have an ancient version of Quicken (2007?) on a desktop I'm trying to phase out. Found this. I was looking to see if Quicken could work on a Chromebook or if I could link to an app. This cloud/web-based option seemed best. I trust the name. I figured on not using my old Quicken data, so I don't mind that it doesn't link. Super easy setup. App is easier to navigate than what I saw on a browser. Love that you can turn on TouchID. So far, so great!"
750,"Finally, Quicken! It's a beta, but I love it so far. For all those giving one star, this is not Quicken or Mint, this is a separate service in beta. They definitely could have communicated that better on the app description. It's much better than mint right out of the box. It can connect to some services I can't in Mint. The best part is that I can upload receipts and PDFs!"
751,This app is so good that I was able to retire instantly.
752,"Love it, one suggestion This app and the YouTube videos has made my anxiety about money pretty much disappear. Even when I overspend I know exactly how much it's going to impact my goals and what I need to do better next time. One thing that I wish you would add is being able to view all your transactions for that category by clicking on the category. I have multiple accounts and sometimes it's hard to find transactions when I'm going ""wait, where did that money go?"""
753,"YNAB completely changed my life. I've been using it for almost two years, and in that time I've paid off nearly $20K of debt and have more savings than I've ever had in my life. It takes a little getting used to, but the support is INCREDIBLE; they'll seriously help you with whatever you need. The mobile app has *almost* all the functionality of the web interface. It'd be nice to see account reconciliation and payee management. All the core functionality is there, though; for everything else, there's the web interface. Seriously if you're struggling with *anything* just reach out to support; you won't be disappointed."
754,"YNAB is hands down the best budgeting app I ever used. They exceed all expectation in terms of customer service, after-sale service, and the app itself is very intuitive and genuinely helpful. The app (and website) itself is intuitive to use and beautifully designed, integrates easily with most financial services (even though not in my country, but it wasn't a problem as unlinked accounts are easy and you can import CSVs), it really is different as it helps you understand your goals and budgets without feeling restrictive. If you're used to ""normal"" budgeting apps that just chart your spending this is NOT IT. This app actively helps you organize it and the best thing about it is that it never felt restrictive, it actually felt as if it gave me more freedom in my finance. I would highly, highly advice using it. And finally, the team seems really friendly from both my email interaction with them to their youtube tutorial. I genuinely feel I wanna work for this company one day. Thanks YNAB team :)."
755,"I tried other budgeting apps, I tried spreadsheets and it didn't work out. YNAB approach is different and it's not limited to this app. There's a website with tons of information and a YouTube channel as well. With YNAB I was able to break free of the paycheck to paycheck cycle. Try it now!! You won't regret it"
756,"Changed my life for the much better and is definitely worth the subscription! You won't be able to figure it out all by yourself, but there's tons of blog posts, youtube guides and tips on their website and on yt, so if you're struggling, check those out!"
757,"I'm good with money but bad with finances, if that makes sense. But once I got married and had kids there were so many more things for 'us' (and not just me) to worry about. YNAB has been an amazing tool for guiding our spending and knowing where we stand with our finances. The money you'll spend on YNAB is well worth it if you can commit to using this tool. That said, there is a definite learning curve, but when I've gotten stuck, the online community and YNAB support has been really good. üëå"
758,"Great app. I wish it had one more feature that can show how much i have budgeted for some annual expenses in my savings account. for example, i use my savings account to save for a new car, new laptop and etc. But all of that money is all added up in one account, it would be nice to see my progress for my savings for individual items"
759,"I never see YNAB listed as a ""top"" financial app---Mint is usually listed though. Shame. YNAB is a game changer. The Android version is as robust as any companion app I've ever used where the main version rests online and best accessed via desktop or laptop."
760,"Life changing! I really thought I was budgeting before, but this is a game changer. No more guessing, know exactly what you have on hand at all times. And customer support is amazing, real people extremely patient and helpful. They go above and beyond!"
761,"YNAB is great! They just added a history of actions taken (""Recent Moves"") which was in my opinion the biggest missing feature. The only thing that would make it better would be knowing what device the move/change took place on. Keep up the great work!"
762,"I used Quicken since 1989 and never thought I would dump it, but I did. YNAB teaches you to actually manage your money, but Quicken, Albert, and Dave do not. YNAB shows you your money through the right lens and helps you build wealth. Our age of money is 55-65 days, meaning we don't fret waiting for our next paycheck. With YNAB, money stress level is a 1. If you want to enjoy money management, use YNAB. But if you love to stress and live on cash advances, YNAB is not for you."
763,"This program is Amazing! I like the desktop web version myself, but in any case YNAB is a steal at $84/yr . I was spending at least a half hour a week trying to manage and reconsile my budget using Mint and a spreadsheet. This does it all. I've taken my budgeting to a new level with YNAB and spending far less time than I used to."
764,Takes a while to get used to the system and adapt it for your needs but it is by far the best budgeting software on the market. The UI is fantastic and it's incredibly organized. Highly recommend!
765,This is the only budgeting app that actually made me stick to a budget. Its helped turned my financial around and I've finally stopped worrying about money. Its a little tricky to learn but it's well worth it and there's plenty of online resources available.
766,"YNAB is a fantastic budgeting tool, showing real-time spending. We have been able to plan accurately because of YNAB. With this latest update, I gave the app 5 stars because I can now see actual spending charges in each sub category and can also reconcile."
767,"It's fun and easy to use - you really couldn't ask for more in a budgeting app. I especially like their video resources, especially the videos from Hannah - they're great learning tools!"
768,"I just downloaded it a few minutes ago after being recommended by a lot of people... So far it feels extremely good and all was in my mind was just take my money!... It's too good... But it's only been some minutes, I'll edit this if I hind something... Sadly the automatic payment thing doesn't work in my country, I'd be lovely if it did... I'm from Nigeria"
769,Cant say enough good things about this app. Easy to use and the videos and help features are great! Ive made it fit my pay schedule and am finally able to budget for real and not by the seat of my pants. Thanks YNAB team!!
770,"YNAB is amazing - both the app / web app and the people / staff. Their budgeting methodology is superb, features and tips are on point, and the app is wonderful. üëå"
771,Great app! A bit hard to get used to but after the learning curve it's amazing. Completely changing the way I look at my money. You also learn a lot about yourself.
772,"I've tried a lot of budget software, but this is the only one I really like. It's a fresh approach to budgeting, backed by excellent software."
773,Great app! Excellent way to see where every penny spent goes. Great way to save money.
774,My 34 day trial is almost over and I have only been able to get YNAB to sync with my bank twice. This has definitely impacted our ability to budget this month.
775,This app has literally changed my financial life. I HATED budgeting before my husband introduced me to this app and now I love it bc I don't feel like I'm living paycheck to paycheck anymore.
776,Interesting budget apps more time to explore... Hopefully will be to manage personal financial with better than before
777,Best app out there for budgeting. Teaches you how to become financially savvy! Tell your money where to go instead of wondering where it went.
778,What a great budgeting app i have tried a vast of budgeting apps but this one is something unique üëå
779,Changed my life. Don't hesitate - install it and go to the Web app to set up!
780,"Love the ynab way of budgeting, I've truely never budgeted like this before üòâ"
781,"Changed my financial life forever. I feel in control and able to remove emotions out of my decision making process when spending or saving money. Since I've discovered this app and the FI community, I'm on track to retire early!"
782,The only budget system that has ever worked for me!
783,Best budgeting software out there! Applying principals of cash spending in a digital world.
784,"I was living paycheck to paycheck for YEARS, and I finally hit that moment where I needed to take control of my spending. I researched to find the best app for me. I tried different ones but non of them worked out. I then gave YNAB a try and after 3 days of using it, I fell in love. Using the app both on my phone and on a desktop is super easy. After every paycheck I gave every dollar a ""job"" and since I have been using it, I have been able to pay off my credit card debt, and now I am saving!"
785,"Sometimes a free app is not going to cut it. This is one of those occasions. If you think you could stick to a budget, or at least be happy trying to, then you need to pay for this app. It is a bit overwhelming at first for many people but there are plenty of free resources provided by YNAB to enable the new user to be up and running before too long. There are plenty of Facebook groups for YNAB demonstrating how many people have benefited from this great software."
786,It would be better for me if the app has Myanmar Currency. Overall experience was perfect.
787,YNAB has completely transformed our lives and how we view money. The web software is where it really shines and the app helps keep you in check. You really do need a budget to get ahead. Thank you for creating an amazing platform for budgeting.
788,"I LOVE your product. So does my daughter who is a senior in highschool. She works a part time job and is in National Guard. However when she tried to take advantage of the free budget, she was told it's only for college students. Please make this available to 18yo high school students! (Still 5 stars bc you deserve it)"
789,The one app/web app that has really changed my daily life. Give it a shot - it easily integrates with your bank and cards. After a lifetime of winging my finances YNAB has helped me to know exactly how my budget looks at any given time. Highly recommended!
790,"Best budgeting software. Never going back!!!! Do yourself a favor. Buy the year subscription and take their FREE classes to become better. Plus, big perk, you can put your budget on multiple phones so your spouse also can see it."
791,Hands down the best budgeting app. It's pretty genius and it's simple once you get it. Definitely read the articles and watch the videos. Saving money is kind of an obsession now.
792,Extremely good app that made a world of difference to my budgeting. I would recommend checking out their Facebook live streams on how to use it to its full extent. Very happy I stumbled across this.
793,Simply the best budgeting app. Set the categories YOU care about and categorize your spending how YOU decide. 120% worth the annual fee to have total visibility into where your money is going. And no ads!
794,Hi im really enjoying the Ynab app alot and I accepting that I'm bounded to pay every month for the app so please keep it on the playstore I really love it.
795,"YNAB is far and away the best budgeting system out there. 1000% worth the cost. I got lost or frustrated with everything else I tried within a couple of months, but now I've been consistent with YNAB for 2 years. The app works smoothly; once in awhile you have to reconnect with your bank, but I think that's very common now with security protocols. Notifications are not intrusive. The interface is super straightforward and makes the method easy. I can't say enough good things about it."
796,"Game changer! This is the best budgeting app on the market. Support is quick to respond if there are issues. I use it to track all aspects of our budget, the tracking accounts let you track anything and break down your budget as granular as you want. I am on this app daily so it has helped me stay on track paying off debt. If you follow the Dave Ramsey plan YNAB compliments it very well. Getting started takes some time but give it 2-months and everything is smooth sailing after that."
797,It takes awhile to get used to. It really is different from most budget programs but it's better because it keeps better track of where you are right now. It has three things in total that it calculates: 1. What to do with what you have in the bank NOW. 2. What you plan to spend but don't have her and 3. It keeps track of what you've spent (with account linking) and warns you when you've gone over. I tried to do the same thing with a spreadsheet but it was too difficult to keep track.
798,The best use of my $83.99. I have been using YNAB faithfully for more than a year now. It was a little labor intensive in the beginning to set up my budget because my finances were in such a mess. I am so glad I continued on with this App. YNAB has change the way I look at my finance. I look forward to pay day so I can go in and budget my money telling it where to go and watch it work hard for me. Thank you YNAB!!
799,"This app really works. I've always lived paycheque to paycheque, and because we both had good incomes there was enough to pay our bills. But we had no real goals, only the desire to retire ""someday"". I started using this app 7 years ago at the suggestion of my son and DIL. It totally changed the way I treat my money, and my ADD brain loves the instant gratification of on-the-fly tracking and reconciliation. Seven years later, we paid off >150k of debt, and we just retired üòä"
800,"I've used many different methods to budget (including consulting with a credit counsellor) and this beats all of those. The courses and tutorials are excellent, as is the direct messaging for support (I received a reply within a 1/2 hr). I was going to give 4 stars just due to the cost, but given the quality of support available I just can't. The monthly fee is justified and worth it. It took 1 month for me to get my budget back on track with YNAB after years of being unsuccessful!"
801,"Life-changing! Watch the videos, join the fb support group and take the time to adopt the YNAB way. If not, I'm not sure if this app will be that helpful. For us, the app is great to reconcile each day, see where my budget is at and help keep things up to date bc I can easily input transactions. For everything else, I go on the desktop version."
802,"This app put me on the right track from an early age. I've had YNAB for about 6 ish years now. Thank you so much, im 25 and have financial freedom thanks to the lessons learned through YNAB Edit: Also, I use Capital One for my two main credit cards, and they have given YNAB issues connecting for 2 years now, but I've noticed the connection is being resolved and today I was able to successfully reconnect and import transactions from Capital One! So im excited"
803,"Been using this app for a few years now! It takes some adjusting like any new habit. ""Budgeting"" is never an easy thing to learn. However, I love that they have free workshops and that they are live so you can ask the questions you need answering. I am not a perfect YNABer but I love how easy and simple they make it. Thank you YNAB!"
804,"I've been using this app for over a year, and damn... It's not only the best budgeting app out there, but it puts the best philosophy for personal finance right in your pocket. And the personal help is amazing too (my only issue has been credit card refunds, I mess them up occasionally). I reccomend this app yo anyone looking to get a better handle on their spending and saving."
805,"I wish the pricing was a little lower, however the app pays for itself and let's you manage your money in very easy way. Also you notice what you're spending with things you didn't know before (like interest). I wish the response time between a payment on the bank and YNAB wss faster but it still works amazingly without a problem!"
806,"Best thing ever!! No other budgeting methods of tools are as simple to use as YNAB. I love all the resources available (they truly help you learn to budget) through the app and how easy it is to navigate and organize (it is my budget afterall). YNAB has helped me break the paycheck to paycheck cycle, pay down my debt, become more financially secure and plan for my future!! I can't wait for more new features."
807,"I've been using YNAB since mid July 2020. Since I started I've saved more money, paid off debts faster, increased my credit score, and become much more confident in my financial state. I highly recommend this software and encourage anyone who decides to try it out, to utilize both the app and computer site together. There are also some awesome Facebook groups full of people who are more than happy to answer your questions. 10/10 would recommend."
808,"This app, and YNAB in general, have completely changed my outlook on money and finances. I'm not scared to look at my bank account anymore, nor do I worry about spending money for whatever reason. I know EXACTLY what my money is doing and where it is. I just wish time travel was a thing so I could make my past self use this app and system way sooner."
809,"Best budgeting, reconciling app out there! This app not only allows me to stay on budget, I'm also able to file the envelope system without going to the bank, carrying cash and envelopes. It not only allows me to stay on track with my bank accounts but credit cards also. There is a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it's amazing!"
810,"I've been using YNAB since it was available on steam exclusively! (That's a LONG time.) I've gotten multiple friends and co-workers using it and it's nothing but rave reviews. There is a bit of a learning curve, but spend a couple of evenings watching some of their fabulous instructional videos and you'll be hooked!"
811,"Amazing app & customer service! This app has saved me so much more than it costs! After 2 years, I'm now saving and budgeting for things I didn't even remember came out of my acct once a year that used to be unpleasant surprises! I have money for all my expenses and finally have an emergency fund and savings! I never worry about whether or not bills will clear. Everything is on autopay now and the funds are always there. Their customer support is instant and so helpful! I love, love, love YNAB!"
812,"Edit: I haven't had any issues with freezing since the last update. Thank you! I love YNAB. It has helped me stick with a budget for months now and I've saved tons of money. The app itself is great except for frequent freezing. I know this isn't an issue on the iPhone version, because my girlfriend uses that."
813,"This is the best budgeting app I've ever used. It is flexible and once you get into it, everything flows very naturally!"
814,"This is that kind of app that you give less than 5 star only when you don't understand it or if you didn't give enough time. Otherwise it's best app and service for personal finance and budgeting, if you use it in desktop also it goes from 5 star to 10."
815,This app has made money management honestly effortless and I cannot talk it up enough. That it's built from the ground up around only budgeting what you have and around assigning and reassigning your money and a lot of focus has gone into making that process easy really puts it above budgeting with a spreadsheet imo. One thing I'd really love to see (though maybe it's intentionally not in) would be multiple named goals for one category. I sometimes forget why I've been saving üòÇ
816,I was nervous about getting the app after reading YNAB because I thought it would be like all the others I have tried...but its not. You prioritize. You give you money jobs and you benefit! So many great tools. I only wish I downloaded it sooner.
817,"This app has changed how I plan for expenses and to get out budget on track. We used to do the old envelope system and everything in cash, but now with debit cards, that just doesn't work. This app is that envelope system on steroids!"
818,I love this app. I've used ynab for years and will use it forever. Well worth the cost. I recommend it to everyone I know.
819,"YNAB is excellent! I read ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi and he brought up YNAB so I had to check it out. I'm 21 and it's really helped me understand my money and where is going. I highly recommend using the desktop version along-side the app!"
820,"Love this app, makes life very easy to see what you can and can't spend as well as keeping track of the important stuff, on the go too. Shame connections are only available in the US. Would love to be able to use that feature in Spain."
821,"Watch the videos! Small learning curve. Great results! Love it! ... Ok, need to update my review. I saved HINDREDS last month because I am on YNAB every day. Dollars have jobs and I want them to work. America! YOU NEED A BUDGET! I will be saving THOUSANDS this year because of this method and app. Thank you! Wish I could give 10 stars!"
822,"I've been budgeting with Dave Ramsey's envelope method, but this app does all the math for you. And i can even allocate money directly to next month, instead of stuffing it in a carry over bucket! Now this is exciting!! Thank you YNAB."
823,"I actively worked against budgeting, and with this app, I have completely turned my financial future around. If you want to budget, this is the BEST way to maintain a good trajectory long-term. YNAB!"
824,Great app to use for your budget! There are many features available (I have yet to use) and it fairly easy to use.I've had YNAB for about 4 months now and I'm glad I have an good way to keep track of my money
825,It's a best budgeting app I've been using since last year. Wanted split option too in selecting banks whilst adding transaction. Sometimes we pay from different banks or sources for one purpose. That's why. :)
826,"YNAB will change the way you look at budgeting. If you're reading this, it means you're considering trying out YNAB. Just do it and thank me later."
827,"It took a while to learn and still learning along the way but this probably is the most time I am aware of my money. Definitely recommended just be patient and use their helping tools i.e. YouTube videos, workshops, articles etc."
828,Fantastic app that just keeps getting better. Easy to navigate and keeps us within budget. Highly recommend.
829,"I can use a credit card and stay on budget every month. Great support and customer service. Budgeting is awesome. Yes, you need a budget!!"
830,"I searched and searched for an app that would allow me to do EVERYTHING I needed to do with my money and this is the only one I could find that does it. I love everything about it. I will continue to use this app... also, great customer service!"
831,"Fantastic budgeting app, it will change how you think about money. With YNAB you can stop tracking where your money goes, and be in charge of where it goes!"
832,My rbc works pretty well on this app but it takes 2 days for the money to be cleared and I shop for groceries
833,Been using for years and taught my children how to budget using this app! Highly recommend!!
834,"Life-changing app! Helps you understand where you want to go, how to get there, and helps you feel good about knowing you will. Learn the 4 Rules, stick with it, it works!"
835,I love YNAB! It took a while to get the hang of but now I use it daily. Really helped my savings.
836,YNAB is a wonderful budgeting tool and im happy with the functionality on the mobile app
837,"Best budgeting app out there. Sure, it costs money. But that 100 dollars it costs a year saves you thousands. 10/10"
838,"The staff is incredible, the YNAB community is very welcoming. I would recommend to anyone."
839,I love listening to this podcast on my way to work! He always has interesting people on that he interviews and helps me to build on my financial independence!
840,Exceptionally well designed app. The educational materials provided are also very helpful.
841,not an understatement when I say this app is life changing. pays for it self tenfold. sooo worth it.
842,LOVE THIS APP! It has changed the way I think about money. Obsessed!
843,So far so good. The only complaint is it links slower than I would like.
844,So nice to know where my money is going. Helps with impulse buying. Love this app!!!
845,"Stable & Quick, great customer service"
846,YNAB (mainly the website version) saved my financial situation
847,so easy to use and excellent features
848,"Dedicated budgeter that needed an upgrade. I decided to give YNAB a try. EveryDollar didn't work for me. I budget what I have, I don't guess what I might need to spend. YNAB moved my budget from pretty good to beyond amazing!! In the 2 months since I've been using it, I have an emergency fund and have budgeted 3 months ahead. I like it so much, I gifted it to my daughter. Now she's on her way to paying off her student loans and saving for a home! Thank you, YNAB!!!"
849,"I live by the YNAB budgeting model and have saved so much money and time with it. App is really useful for adding transactions on the spot, not as functional as the website though. Still serves its purpose perfectly. If I could suggest one feature it would be adding a basic calculator to adding or spliting transactions."
850,YNAB has been a complete lifesaver. We managed to go from $20k+ debt to $20k emergency fund in 3 years on a single $50k salary (plus severance pay and coronavirus stimulus). The live training sessions are invaluable for learning not only the YNAB software but budgeting in general. I can't recommend it enough!
851,Best budgeting app o have used.
852,This app is extremely helpful! I was able to set up a budget plan based on my available funds. It's easy to break down and catagorize your bills. Can create custom categories.. also customer Services is extremely helpful and responded extremely fast with a detailed Answer
853,Changed my life. Don't hesitate - install it and go to the Web app to set up!
854,Nice
855,"Have not used it, yet!"
856,"YNAB completely changed my life. I've been using it for almost two years, and in that time I've paid off nearly $20K of debt and have more savings than I've ever had in my life. It takes a little getting used to, but the support is INCREDIBLE; they'll seriously help you with whatever you need. The mobile app has *almost* all the functionality of the web interface. It'd be nice to see account reconciliation and payee management. All the core functionality is there, though; for everything else, there's the web interface. Seriously if you're struggling with *anything* just reach out to support; you won't be disappointed."
857,Nice app
858,"Changed my life for the much better and is definitely worth the subscription! You won't be able to figure it out all by yourself, but there's tons of blog posts, youtube guides and tips on their website and on yt, so if you're struggling, check those out!"
859,"Love it, one suggestion This app and the YouTube videos has made my anxiety about money pretty much disappear. Even when I overspend I know exactly how much it's going to impact my goals and what I need to do better next time. One thing that I wish you would add is being able to view all your transactions for that category by clicking on the category. I have multiple accounts and sometimes it's hard to find transactions when I'm going ""wait, where did that money go?"""
860,"Life changing! I really thought I was budgeting before, but this is a game changer. No more guessing, know exactly what you have on hand at all times. And customer support is amazing, real people extremely patient and helpful. They go above and beyond!"
861,"Love the ynab way of budgeting, I've truely never budgeted like this before üòâ"
862,"I never see YNAB listed as a ""top"" financial app---Mint is usually listed though. Shame. YNAB is a game changer. The Android version is as robust as any companion app I've ever used where the main version rests online and best accessed via desktop or laptop."
863,"I tried other budgeting apps, I tried spreadsheets and it didn't work out. YNAB approach is different and it's not limited to this app. There's a website with tons of information and a YouTube channel as well. With YNAB I was able to break free of the paycheck to paycheck cycle. Try it now!! You won't regret it"
864,"YNAB is amazing - both the app / web app and the people / staff. Their budgeting methodology is superb, features and tips are on point, and the app is wonderful. üëå"
865,"YNAB is hands down the best budgeting app I ever used. They exceed all expectation in terms of customer service, after-sale service, and the app itself is very intuitive and genuinely helpful. The app (and website) itself is intuitive to use and beautifully designed, integrates easily with most financial services (even though not in my country, but it wasn't a problem as unlinked accounts are easy and you can import CSVs), it really is different as it helps you understand your goals and budgets without feeling restrictive. If you're used to ""normal"" budgeting apps that just chart your spending this is NOT IT. This app actively helps you organize it and the best thing about it is that it never felt restrictive, it actually felt as if it gave me more freedom in my finance. I would highly, highly advice using it. And finally, the team seems really friendly from both my email interaction with them to their youtube tutorial. I genuinely feel I wanna work for this company one day. Thanks YNAB team :)."
866,Nice
867,Best app out there for budgeting. Teaches you how to become financially savvy! Tell your money where to go instead of wondering where it went.
868,Good app
869,*perfect*
870,Goodbye

877,Interesting budget apps more time to explore... Hopefully will be to manage personal financial with better than before
878,Great app! A bit hard to get used to but after the learning curve it's amazing. Completely changing the way I look at my money. You also learn a lot about yourself.
879,Love this app
880,A life changing app!

890,Best budget app I have ever used. Takes some time to learn the system but it is the only budget software I have used that actually helps me save money and reach my goals.
891,Nice app
892,"I'm good with money but bad with finances, if that makes sense. But once I got married and had kids there were so many more things for 'us' (and not just me) to worry about. YNAB has been an amazing tool for guiding our spending and knowing where we stand with our finances. The money you'll spend on YNAB is well worth it if you can commit to using this tool. That said, there is a definite learning curve, but when I've gotten stuck, the online community and YNAB support has been really good. üëå"
893,Best budgeting software out there! Applying principals of cash spending in a digital world.
894,"I just downloaded it a few minutes ago after being recommended by a lot of people... So far it feels extremely good and all was in my mind was just take my money!... It's too good... But it's only been some minutes, I'll edit this if I hind something... Sadly the automatic payment thing doesn't work in my country, I'd be lovely if it did... I'm from Nigeria"

924,"YNAB is a fantastic budgeting tool, showing real-time spending. We have been able to plan accurately because of YNAB. With this latest update, I gave the app 5 stars because I can now see actual spending charges in each sub category and can also reconcile."

927,This is the only budgeting app that actually made me stick to a budget. Its helped turned my financial around and I've finally stopped worrying about money. Its a little tricky to learn but it's well worth it and there's plenty of online resources available.
928,Cant say enough good things about this app. Easy to use and the videos and help features are great! Ive made it fit my pay schedule and am finally able to budget for real and not by the seat of my pants. Thanks YNAB team!!
929,"I used Quicken since 1989 and never thought I would dump it, but I did. YNAB teaches you to actually manage your money, but Quicken, Albert, and Dave do not. YNAB shows you your money through the right lens and helps you build wealth. Our age of money is 55-65 days, meaning we don't fret waiting for our next paycheck. With YNAB, money stress level is a 1. If you want to enjoy money management, use YNAB. But if you love to stress and live on cash advances, YNAB is not for you."
930,Great.
931,This app has literally changed my financial life. I HATED budgeting before my husband introduced me to this app and now I love it bc I don't feel like I'm living paycheck to paycheck anymore.
932,"This program is Amazing! I like the desktop web version myself, but in any case YNAB is a steal at $84/yr . I was spending at least a half hour a week trying to manage and reconsile my budget using Mint and a spreadsheet. This does it all. I've taken my budgeting to a new level with YNAB and spending far less time than I used to."
933,Nice
934,So nice app
935,This service is a game changer. I highly recommend using it.

941,"YNAB is great! They just added a history of actions taken (""Recent Moves"") which was in my opinion the biggest missing feature. The only thing that would make it better would be knowing what device the move/change took place on. Keep up the great work!"
942,"It's fun and easy to use - you really couldn't ask for more in a budgeting app. I especially like their video resources, especially the videos from Hannah - they're great learning tools!"

952,"Love love love chime !!! When signing up I messed up ig on my social, so I didnt qualify. I got in touch with them through Facebook and they fixed that for me asap!! So, when using this app I can have a regular account and savings all for free! And if you have a savings account, they allow you to gain interest!! Sure its only a few cents here and there but its pretty cool,and to top that they let you know often about how much u have and even add lil emojis!so cute"
953,It is exactly to the point as it is described in print. Once the direct deposit is set up things get 10 times easier. I'll be honest online banking has been a hassle and I've had some scam situations but this has been true to the print so far; no issues love the app easy to transfer between savings and checking and it texts you the charge that was made and the account balance after every purchase it really is a good app 5 stars!
954,"The app is smooth and easy to navigate. The bank has a lot of cool and helpful features... Especially SpotMe, where you can overdraw up to $200 with no fee or hidden penalty... It's paid back automatically with your next direct deposit. The only drawback I can see is they are an online only bank, so if their network crashes, you're stuck with no access to your money until they fix it. I had to go 3 days once with plenty of money in the bank and zero access to it... And that was painful"
955,"This app is amazing, whenever I had an issue which was only maybe once or twice it was resolved right away or I didn't even have to mention it. Chime caught and fix the problem right away! They respond quickly to your questions and always there when you need to talk to someone. Their credit building program is amazing! It actually does help your credit. I went from 650 to 713 in 90 days. Not to mention you get your deposit 2 days early! I wouldn't trade Chime for no other bank."
956,"I absolutely love Chime. I've been using it for about 3 months and no problems at all. I'm able to transfer money to or from my other accounts easily. Not only is the account free, you can take money out of an atm at 7-11, cvs, Walgreens and many others free of charge from your debit or your credit builder card. The credit builder card is awesome. Using credit builder, in 2 months, my score went up 93 on one agency and 130 on the other. Enough to qualify for a new unsecured credit card. üíìüëçüëç"
957,"Great mobile banking app. Transferring money between spending and saving accounts is a breeze. Still trying to wrap my head around some parts of the credit builder portion. It feels like it almost invalidates the need for the checking account, but it works well for building your credit. I hardly spend any money directly from my checking account anymore unless it's required."
958,"The absolute best banking app I've ever used. real-talk if you want a card that there are no hidden fees. They make it clear about the only fees and how much before I initially requested a card, and have not switched-up since. They even have spot me, which is money they let you over-draw, then they just take it out the next deposit,but fee-free. These guys are an excellent choice, real-talk."
959,I love using chime banking. The app is awesome. I'm so glad they have to 10% of payroll deductions to put in savings. They also can round up every purchase to nearest dollar and put that in savings. I'm so surprised how much money I saved at end of week. I just wish there was an option to hide my saving part so I don't see how much is there every time I log in. I still love chime banking.
960,"I love Chime. I have no problems with them whatsoever. I had an issue one time with a merchant charging me more than the purchase price and they credited my account immediately until the problem was resolved. The only downside, there is no actual banking establishment to go into to discuss anything face to face"
961,I have had Chime for 6-7 years now and I have never had any issues with it. My checks are always available earlier than normal and I love how there are no hidden fees. Chim is one of the few things I actually recommend to people because I know they won't be let down. Keep on doing what you're doing Chime! I love it üíö
962,When I tell you I LOVE chime I wish I could just scream it from a mountain top. I've had the debit card for over four years now and it has been a blessing. Spot me is amazing at avoiding any stupid overdraft fees and when you need a little extra before next pay day. I've also got the chime builder card and let me say it's just as amazing. My credit has gone up almost 60+ points! I absolutely love chime!!!!
963,"I love Chime, have been using it for years. The free transfers between friends and family are awesome, and the Credit Builder card has helped me add about 90 pts to my credit score. The ONLY thing I would change is that it doesn't seem like there is a ""credit limit"" reported to the bureaus for credit utilization scoring. Maybe make the highest statement balance of the prev. rolling 6-12 months the reported credit limit? This could help people even more, using the service you already provide."
964,"It gets the job done! No gliching, chime preformes well.. For me thats how's the functionality? It works spot on! If i had to give my #1 reason why chime rocks! It gives me full controll of my finances with lighting fast capabilities. I had lost hope with banking institutions.. Crazy over draft fees! Monthly fees, ATM CHARGES!. Thank you Cash app, for providing me an app that puts my financial power where it should be! Makes perfect sense!"
965,This app is absolutely amazing. I have no complaints at all. I can see how much is on my chime card. I can see where I have used chime card an how much I have spent at each place. An the savings account is a bonus for me. The app is absolutely perfect. No lagging no problems signing in. Keep up the amazing work.
966,It's amazing! I absolutely did not get paid to say this. I've had so many different banks and this one tops it all! I see exactly where and when my card was used and I takes me feel secure knowing if someone tried to get into my account I'd know instantly. I can monitor my spending and saving. It it literally the best and I wouldn't go to any other bank. Super easy app to use also
967,"Chime is actually a life saver! Without their spot me, I would've been in a tough situation. I started at a $40 limit and was later increased to $60 based on spending history and deposits. Not to mention chime has a credit building system! Ditch your old bank, this is the way. And no I'm not a bot here's proof üçëüçÜ üò§üòâ"
968,Chime is great. Been with them 3yrs and love it. Great customer service. My kids got one and we each got $50. Spotme is great in a pinch. The discounts they have within the app for other companies is good. Fingerprint login and direct deposit 2 days early is very convenient. Instant notification when deposits hit or money removed. A++++
969,"Every time I speak to a come agent they are always super nice and always work as hard as theythe cash to fix it issue and 99% of the time they do, & they give u a good amount of information on what your asking about. Love the agents and this back app. I only use my chime. This is my only bank account and use it for legit everything. Love love love it"
970,"Love this card. Immediately attends to security concerns. Charges that you question or dispute. Immediately ends card use, issues temporary number and sends another one. Sends out paper checks when requested, tracks and notifies upon receipt of payment. Love it."
971,"LOVE CHIME! I have banked with them since I THINK 2015/16. I NEVER EVER had issues using this app! Direct deposit always comes early & right ON TIME, EVERYTIME. My new fav. product of theirs is the CREDIT BUILDER CARD!! The ONLY thing I DON'T like is that you CAN'T deposit checks with large amounts for some reason. For instance, I wanted to deposit it a check for a little over $7,000 and I couldn't, I had to deposit it into my chase account instead!"
972,"Simply the best!! Chime is not only a debit card but an actual bank, without hidden fees or services charges. Best of all, you can borrow by way of overdraft and leaving a tip is optional. The tip is for the no charge overdraft. Chime also provides you with offers that will help build your credit score. Customer service is awesome!! Your money is protected and secured. I would recommend Chime to any and everyone. You get a checking, savings, and credit building account. Chime is the best!!"
973,"It's a very solid business. I dig it and have been using it since the conception of the business. Spot Me is really nice, and works payday is Thursday, but I get paid on Tuesday with chime. I love it, get it. Do it now."
974,"Best service ever! I moved from Cedar to Salt Lake never activated my car between that time and it's 4th of July weekend and they still got back to me within the same day quick stat!! Super nice people and so freaking helpful of my gosh!!! I never wore reviews but when I have OUTSTANDING service I will!! The support team is just amazing and so nice!! Through a holiday I got a response, and my information was updated immediately!! Best support team!!!!"
975,As of just today right now app keeps freezing when I open it .. what's going on maybe has something to do with update? Please help or fix .. now I tried to uninstall then reinstall and still freezes but now I can't login with my fingerprints either. Before I wasn't able to use my pin but I was able to use my fingerprints. Bummer
976,"I love being in control of my finances. I love knowing every transaction, and the credit boost is there is you need it. Up to $100 evety if you need it. I like the ease of setting up the savings account and the credit building accout. It os all under your control with CHIME!"
977,I love chime it makes my life easy. With my monthly benefits direct eposited i have activated Spot me a perk that lets me overdraft my account ( in case of an emergency ) by up to $100 dollars that i incur no fees for and can payback with my next direct deposit - deposit. I also enrolled in Credit Builder where i transfer money /account that works like regular credit card( credit card arrives within days of enrollment) Report to credit bureaus on time payments/payment history..raise your score
978,I have struggled trying multiple banking options before Chime.Without a doubt Chime has been the best banking I've ever used. Been using chime the last 4 years and I've never had any worries as far as overdraft or holds or even security. I literally have complete control over my budget and my card thats used everywhere. Chime you rock! Highly recommend
979,"I love my Chime account! Spot Me is so helpful & the mobile app is great. I always know what is in my account, I'm able to deposit checks via the app, and it's so easy to use."
980,"Fast, simple, informative and easy to control. Always informs me of a purchase and I love the ability to disable my card in the settings of the app. So far, pretty great!"
981,"Best application out there, it's actually designed for the people. No hidden. Fees, no extra fee for using the spot me account. Everything has been truly great, it helps me with savings and being able to manage my money. And getting pay 2 days early helps!"
982,Great app. Its really banking made easy. I had the app for almost a year and never had one problem with it at all. No over draft fees. Just page what you took out if you you use overdraft. Move money instantly from checking to savings or credit builder card.
983,"Best banking experience of my life. Customer service is hands down, the best. No fees ever. Literally best banking of my life. Oops, repetitive. üòÅ Absolutely no complaints whatsoever. Been a customer for over a year and always telling anyone that'll listen, how great Chime is. Big fan!!! Pamela Elmore"
984,Best support system I've had in a very long time customer service has always been on time and is always wanting to meet the needs of their customer even though we've gone through hard times this bank has always been there and customer support and never excuse as to why they did not they always manage to make sure that their customer service was intact to ensure that a customer received what they needed during these hard times I would highly recommend this Bank
985,"Chime is absolutely the best banking experience I have ever had. I get my paycheck early, there are no fees for checking, you get free ATM's, and you can get up to two hundred dollars in payroll advance. Most importantly there are no overdraft fees!!! Chime, you're the best!"
986,Love this app! It's legit and helps keep an eye on any fraudulent activity. So far so good. Haven't had good experiences with other banks and my accounts being hacked...
987,So far I love chime. It has a few glitches where it will say temporarily unavailable but aside from that it's great real time updates so no surprises. I love it.
988,Still love it. No complaints! Lovin' it so far. Been about a month. I love the Spot Me feature. I can always use a little extra between paydays...it has been much appreciated. Keep up the excellent work.‚ò∫
989,For a free banking app I feel like there really on top of things with my security and banking needs they have there little fees like all the rest but the service though immediate response times with paper work canceled card all within the hour 2 years I've had chime I'd highly recommend you guys..
990,"Amazing financial account. Spot Me is the ultimate no-fee ""overdraft."" Love getting my direct deposit 2 days early. So easy to use. So many benefits (savings, credit builder, Spot Me + boosts, and more.) Highly recommend!"
991,This is my absolute favorite online banking tool. The app is very convenient and easy to use. I also feel that Chime goes above and beyond expectations when it comes to security and privacy. I couldn't be more satisfied with Chime and all of it's services.
992,This card can really change your life if you're a person with no credit at all in about 6 months you will go from zero to practically perfect if you're rebuilding your credit like I had to literally my score went up 50 points the first month 30 points the second month and I went from bad credit to good credit so I have enough credit with the interest will not kill me to buy a home thank you time
993,After a year I still love this bank. Still amazing. One major question l have is when will you offer a truly contactless payment debit/visa card? It's becoming an issue because of the pandemic and transit systems in NYC planning to switch over to this method permanently.
994,"The absolute best banking experience I've had. My favourite thing would have to be the fact that Chime is so quick to notify, the atm is still counting out my money and I'm already buzzing that my card has been used at X location"
995,I havent had any problems with this bank or app. The Spot Me feature has saved me more than once and I don't ever pay any fees!!
996,"I just recently got involved with Chime and I have never used a bank before and you always see all the TV adds, but Chime is everything that they advertise and I am extremely happy with Chime. Thank you Chime."
997,By far the best bank ive ever had!!! I left wells fargo and chase and just sticked solemly to chime . I get my direct deposit 2 days prior to everyone else . Not just that also my stimulus checks i received 2 days ahead from everyone else as well as my tax returns always the first one to receive. very convinient tool called spot me. I can literally overdraft up to 75$ and chime spots me to complete the payment . With NO OVERDRAFT FEE!! i can deposit funds withdraw evethying like a regular bank
998,"This is a fav of mine. So far it has been reliable, even lenient on over drafting.nice polite ppl to talk to. I recommend this app and card. I marked it up, seems I got another cool card from chime.and I might add theres no bs here. Thx chime !"
999,The only thing I would say could be fixed is when you transfer money from one card to the other it won't let you transfer from your savings to your credit builder you first have to transfer to spending account then transfer to credit builder card other than that chime is great and easy to use
1000,"It has far exceeded my expectations. Haven't gotten a single fee. I'm so glad I opened an account with Chime. Not having access to an actual brick and mortar bank, has not been an issue or inconvenience."
1001,"I love this account, I never worried about over draft. The Spot me, have save me many times. Early pay day is a Joy. I love the way it let me know every transaction that is made on my account.. Chime Please don't change.."
1002,Easy to use. Easy to work with. Needs to be able to add second owner on the account. But makes saving easy. Keeps their promises.
1003,Have been using for three years now and love it. The spot me comes in handy when short on money and get paid faster now you can send boost of $5 to your friends and family and when you invite new people to join chime through your link you and them is $75
1004,"Best card ever !!!! I've tried some of the others, but nothing comes close to Chime. Real savings options. Overdraft limit - Free! Instant notifications Paid early And so many extras I still haven't explored"
1005,I have only had it for a few months now. And I love it. The fact that you can put savings yourself and that they take Little extra change into your savings I like that Feature. Also getting paid 2 days before my actual payday.
1006,"Chime is the greatest thing that I've ever had. Never any issues. Quick money transfers, always tells me right away where my card is used and how much was spent. I just cannot say enough good things about Chime and their associates. Completely recommend."
1007,Its super simple and super effective. I have my direct deposit set up and every time i make a purchase with my card i get a notification on my phone about it. Very great survice!!!!
1008,"love it, really made finances easier to manage having mutiple options in the one account and adding money at a convenience store any day any time beats the h*ll out of standing in line at a bank."
1009,"I love love it! instant transfers between accounts.. spot me feature saved my behind a time or two.. straight forward app design, easy to navigate.. I can't say enough great things!"
1010,So far everything has been better than great.. I love the fact i also have a savings acct on the same chime app.. Plus transferring money has never been easier.. I have found my bank. Thanks Chime.
1011,"I highly recommend Chime to everyone I come in contact with. I've never experienced any type of issues with Chime directly but I've had issues with Cash app and YouTube (unauthorized charges and scamming companies, money was withdrawn from my Chime acct) Chime replaced the money while an investigation was done and took care of every detail for me. If they even think a company or charge is fraudulent they will not allow the charge to go through and send me a text."
1012,"I love using chime, never had any issues with the app or the cards. I love the savings and credit lines too. I do wish they had multiple accounts available for savings, for like different categories of savings. 100% would recommend!"
1013,"I love this app, I will recommend it to all my friends and family and anyone who hates to pay monthly fees to the banks. This is FREE and a GREAT way to save money by not paying EVER NSF fees!!!!!!"
1014,"Super easy to use for anything to do send money or to change from a big namr bank only other thing they had was if I could earn crypto intend of just rounding up , but good easy customer service an nice 2 days early on getting a pay check!"
1015,One of the easiest and most efficient banking apps in 2021. Sending money to friends and family is effortless and I love the fact of getting paid 2 days earlier. I can say without doubt that this is one of the best apps on my phone.
1016,The App has excellent easy to use tools that are VERY helpful and keep me in total control of my money and it's a PLEASURE to use. Also the SPOT ME feature is a GROUNDBREAKING Customer Service feature that gives a GREAT sense of Security to Customers!
1017,"I love chime banking and chime app, its nice and easy to move around and transfer money from one place to the other. I'm currently still using it after all these years"
1018,"This is a very easy to use app. I really like the banking services such as ""Spot Me"" that will cover you if you over draw by a little bit."
1019,Love this card and the benefits it gives. So easy and so helpful to keep up with ur transactions. Customer service is really nice & friendly. Ill will suggest this card to everyone. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
1020,Since i had chime everything has been going great. My check been showing up in my account two days early. They even have a 10% savings of your check which is nice. Plus a way to build your credit which i just signed up too.
1021,I received my transferred money in three days. I thought It was like paypal you receive it instantly if you pay 1%. Because I needed the money immediately. The app is ok btw.
1022,Spot me is a cool feature to have for free. Easy to transfer between accounts. Supported by most Crypto/stock exchanges.
1023,Great support chat and very friendly customer service. No issues with the application. Spotme and credit builder are amazing. I really appreciate those features.
1024,"I love it. Makes it easy for me to get my checks early, there is an overdraft with no fees in case I am shirt. Just knowing that I have that type of cushion and comfort is a great feeling to have"
1025,"Best bank ever. The best parts are early paydays and the overdraft without the fees. You do have the option to tip, which I do because when the overdraft amounts are covered it is such a blessing."
1026,So far I'm liking chime. I haven't had any issues and my paycheck does come two days early. I also like the fact that I can have a portion of my paycheck automatically put into my savings account and chime also has a credit builder account with a separate card for that account.
1027,So far so good. I was a bit hesitant to open an account. But I'm glad I did. Everything has been working great. Oh the SpotMe feature is truly helpful.
1028,"It is a top notch banking app. For the 4 different apps I currently use, and the additional five or so that I have previously used, Chime is a top tier app."
1029,"This is best online bank account I've had! It very organized ,easy to use, informative on ALL spending and fraudulent activities ."
1030,Awesome customer service and amazing features!!! If your looking for the best mobile banking app there is look no further you just found it!!!
1031,"So far Love this easy simple way of banking.. load it use it for all my bills, get my direct deposit and so much more. Also waiting for the credit builder see how that goes ‚ú®üôè"
1032,Lovvvve it. Perfect.... Except for one tiny issue.... I do not wana b constantly reminded of my balance. After a weekend of spending... I do not want a constant reminder of my terrible spending habits. Lollll.
1033,"Chime is fantastic. Their app is great and easy to use too. Get any information about ATMs, transfer funds, and deposit checks with ease."
1034,I have only had 1 problem with my direct deposit...only once and it was because it was stuck somewhere in limbo...other than that...I love having the freedom of my chime card
1035,I really love banking with them they're convenient and very easy to use. They also gives you an option to start up a credit card account which is very helpful.
1036,"Besides ally chime has given me the best...actually the best mobile banking experience of all ive tried, and ive tried a lot. My credit score has gone up round 100+ pointa since i started using the credit builder card as well."
1037,"I've been with Chime for over a year now. Chime is as advertised, no hidden fees, no issues in app, and excellent customer service."
1038,By far the best online banking app. Love it and would be lost without it. Chime is the absolute best ever!!!
1039,"Chime has been so great! Early paydays are consistent. Customer Service is knowledgeable and helpful, as well as willing to listen. Thanks Chime! You guys rock!ü§ò"
1040,It's very handy to have you don't have to pay no outrageous price for a savings and it's right there at your fingertips and you can transfer money from your savings to your spending and your spending to your savings anytime you want!!
1041,"Amazing app, I haven't had any issues with that bank and I extremely positively recommend this bank for those trying to start out on a new bank!!"
1042,"Love it. Its way to easy to use and very trustworthy. Plus I never have to make a trip to the bank ever again only to many ATM locations at your convenience. Thanks, Mrs. Tolzmann ‚òÆÔ∏è üíú ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1043,"I haven't reviewed? Odd. not going into detail ppl but if you don't bleep w/Chime you should. To the Developer - please go to sleep. When your up you do stuff like mentioned in ""Account Agreement Updates"" I cant!! Been w/u since the start. Cant fathom the thought of what else you may do. . U got me! U got me! FOR REAL THO Thank you ! it's an honor. ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ.......‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ"
1044,"My experience with chime has been life changing, my income has grew tremendously with all of the perks that comes with having a chimes banking account.Just like they advertised, you get your deposit 3 days EARLY! Chimes also help me to get a secured credit card, which resulted my credit score to rise. Thanks you chimes"
1045,"I just started using Chime a few weeks ago and thus far I am thoroughly impressed and pleasantly surprised. I've not had any issues with my card being declined, the security features for protecting your account are spot on, and receiving my direct deposit two days early is so helpful. The SpotMe feature is also a godsend for that trip to the grocery store or gas station when payday is still a day or two away. I give Chime a five out of five. Two thumbs way, way up. üëçüëç"
1046,I love this app! Its easy to use no hidden fees. I get my paycheck 2 days early. They mean everything they say!
1047,"I've used chime for well over a year now and have no regrets about choosing it as my personal online bank. It's the best game around as far as I'm concerned, and I recommend it every chance I can"
1048,Great experience. Any problems with the account were promptly handled with understanding and expertise. Love it.
1049,"I love it. No atmosphere fees @ 7-Eleven,wawa. Thousands of of other SPOTS! ! Let's no forget The Spot Me feature, is over the top.. comes in handy."
1050,Love it. Raised my credit score and it's easy and efficient. Sending and receiving money is a breeze.
1051,Absolutely wonderful bank to use. Started an account to separate from my ex and not only do I have tremendous control of my finances now but my credit score has gone up over 150+ points with the truly free credit builder card
1052,"Had a friend steal my card and tried to get all my money off it but chime canceled my card and sent me a new one fast ,thank u chime"

1065,Best online bank I've ever come across
1066,Love it
1067,"So far this has been a great banking experience. The only problem I have is you cannot order checks, I have to pay bill by check or money order and their checks take 7 to15 days to get there, it can't get there before a late charge is tacked on. So i have to buy a money order. That is inconvenient. Otherwise I have direct deposit and its great."

1127,So Easy And Convenient!
1128,Best
1129,I luv it all my banking in one
1130,"A friend recommened chime and I've been in love since. So much better then your traditional banking. I love getting paid up to 2 days early, I love not having fee's, and I LOVE the builder credit card. It has helped my credit so much."
1131,"Cheated me out of my credit builder account. I was in 1st place then the took it of my app, till this day I still can't see it on my app"
1132,I have had Chime for 6-7 years now and I have never had any issues with it. My checks are always available earlier than normal and I love how there are no hidden fees. Chim is one of the few things I actually recommend to people because I know they won't be let down. Keep on doing what you're doing Chime! I love it üíö
1133,I love this card and the app it gives u up to date information the only downside is it cost 4.95 to put cash on the card at stores they should lower the price or have no fee
1134,Love this card! Credit builder actually raised my score! It's so easy to use as debit/credit/savings account.
1135,Wonderful. Always get my paycheck 2 days early. Love Chime!!!
1136,üòé‚úÖüòé
1137,The money just keeps flowing
1138,‚ù§Ô∏è
1139,Good
1140,Lovvvve it. Perfect.... Except for one tiny issue.... I do not wana b constantly reminded of my balance. After a weekend of spending... I do not want a constant reminder of my terrible spending habits. Lollll.
1141,Love it
1142,Great
1143,Best online bank period!
1144,Nice! You can use this for everything.
1145,"Love this card. Immediately attends to security concerns. Charges that you question or dispute. Immediately ends card use, issues temporary number and sends another one. Sends out paper checks when requested, tracks and notifies upon receipt of payment. Love it."
1146,"Best mobile banking out there,nuff said"
1147,Outstanding Services!
1148,"This is a fav of mine. So far it has been reliable, even lenient on over drafting.nice polite ppl to talk to. I recommend this app and card. I marked it up, seems I got another cool card from chime.and I might add theres no bs here. Thx chime !"
1149,Lovely
1150,Best card I've had. Came from NetSpend after several times my account was hacked. Been two years and nothing but respect and they will loan you money with no interest. The longer you are with the the more it goes up. Up to two hundred.
1151,The easiest and most convenient banking app I've ever used. Being able to help friends with the spotme boost is also a game changer
1152,Easy to save with this app. Easy to understand. There is one feature I wish it had. To give YES or NO txt option when depositing money from overdraft protection/rainy day fund into account. Several times I went under set amount but was getting paid the next day. I would have declined the withdrawal from rainy day fund if given option. Still love the app though.
1153,"This is a class act app,I didn't really know what it would do when I signed up but after them saving my account from being overdrawn I was really impressed I kept seeing + amounts from digit I was like wow they just seemed to be pouring money into my account to keep in a positive state,they also can invest for you set up retirement and more!! Great!!"
1154,"The only time I've ever saved money!! This is the easiest app to use and you can control everything. How much it transfers, if your account drops below a certain amount it won't touch it, U can set a max daily amount for it to save for you. It's the best! My daughter and I have saved over a thousand dollars in the last 6 months of using this and that never would've happened if we'd have been just trying to save ourselves"
1155,"Great app, helps me save in cool ways, and I was never very good at saving money hah. If you want an app that will put aside money for you, all automated to just set and forget for a while, and without ever having to worry about it accidentally overdrawing your account too then you'll love this. Right now I have it set to put aside a little bit of money every once and a while in an investment portfolio and it's great! I'm satisfied, 5 stars"
1156,"Best savings app I've ever had. I am OCD when it comes to my money and how I want it saved. You can have as many savings groups as you want, it NEVER over drafts you, and you can withdraw at any point. It's a 90/10 for me. I will have this app for a long time."
1157,"I LOVE THIS APP!!!! I literally do not know what I would do without it. If you need help saving for certain things, paying off credit cards sooner, not to mention paying your phone bill every month Get this app!!"
1158,"Saves money for you with out you worrieing about remembering to save. It sends your money back to you when it sees your under a certain amount. Only down fall is its not instant, weather it's sending money cause your low or you ask to withdrawal it, it takes a day or two to get the money, good so you have to wait and rethink your purchase, bad if you need the money now. It also wont take anymoney out if you ynder a certain amount so it wont make you broke while trying to save money."
1159,This app is great! I used it to save up a bit of money over a period of time. I got let go from my job and luckily had enough funds to pay off my bills until I got a new job. Definitely keeping this app!
1160,Love digit. Love the little guy who talks to you. Love the text messages and how I'm greeted every day with my balance. Best app I've ever found. I work for tips and never think about putting money away and digit does it for me!
1161,"I love digit. Definitely helps save money for rainy day or goals. One of the biggest downfalls is the amount of money it puts towards my CC. It'll save money (for me it saved over $300+) and instead of me having the option to choose how much I wanted to go towards my bill, it literally sent all of that to the CC balance."
1162,I was really leary about using this app but I gave it a try. I have savings in here & different goals set up. I put money in goals myself & the times I don't Digit does it & I don't feel like I am missing the money out of my account. You want to save money this is a good way.
1163,"I am so surprised at how much money I've saved with this app. It charges you $5/month after the first month, which annoyed me at first, but I can confirm now it's totally worth it. I've saved over $1,500 in one year. Highly recommend!"
1164,Love this service. The savings withdrawals are unobtrusive but add up faster than I thought they would. Easy to manage your account and you have rapid access to your savings whenever the need arises.
1165,"So far everything is working great. It does take money out in pretty big chunks but its money I honestly barely notice leaving anyways, better to go into a savings account than be spent on gas station food or something."
1166,This app is amazing it takes so little from what you have everyday so it doesn't hurt as much but save the amount of going out to eat everyday for months can add up my favorite feature is the goals because I can plan out big purchases and match with whatever I put in my savings or my next paycheck
1167,I find this app very helpful and you can manage your money safely and invest on daily basis that is wonderful. I only wish that the money I put on my rainy day saving one day they can give access to invest it automatically and have profit on it too.
1168,"Awesome app, really love it and it works great!! It has helped me save for different goals and make extra credit Card payments!!"
1169,It's a great app to help save money! You don't even notice when it withdraws money which is awesome! I saved $150 in a little over a week and it's not complicated to withdraw the money from the app either üòä
1170,Its good if you tend to spend more than you plan to and you need an app to spot you! Itll save so much just by taking a little at a time and i highly recommend it!
1171,"Amazing!!!! I love looking into my Digit app, and seeing how much money it has saved for me. At times like this it's very helpful."
1172,Excellent way to save money. Had it for a while andnit really does help with the tucked away nest egg that's out of the way so you don't spend it.
1173,"Perfect for saving money, a must have. And you don't even notice money is missing, slow grind with a huge result."
1174,Really does help make saving easy. Small withdrawals everyday that you dont even know its comming out of your account. Wish i would have started this a long time ago.
1175,"I love this style of saving. I've saved so much with this app. However, if the price goes up much more I'll have to make a difficult decision about whether to continue using it."
1176,"I actually forgot that I had this money being saved. Being able to come and utilize it in a time of need, is awesome! I like that its saving for me, without worry!"
1177,"I love thise app. It makes saving money easy. You can also invest, or pay off credit cards. It's an awesome app!"
1178,This is the type of saving that works for me. I get nervous to move hug chunks of money at once out of my checking account into saving. So moving little by little into my savings account is what works for me! 2k in retirement and 6k in savings in 6 months?! Ok!!
1179,I dont know how but this app manages to squirrel away money for me without missing it. Withdrawing money is easy and fast too.
1180,I love this app. Saves for me keeps me updated. Less logins for me to check on my accounts.
1181,Great app I just set it up and it does the rest. Never been able to really save before but this makes it easy.
1182,Great app. Easy way to save up money or credit payments made automatically.
1183,Best way to save money. I love this app it has saved me over 3 thousand dollars so far. It would of been more but I keep taking it out to use..
1184,The app is very user-friendly. It is being used by both myself and my adult daughter. It has allowed us to save significantly.
1185,This app has been great to build up savings without even thinking about it. It does the work for me. Great app!
1186,"Great app, great setup, and good costumers care. I truly recommend Digit"
1187,Im very pleased with the minimal savings I accured. It feels good to be automated a know when life get crazy savings is in action no matter the circumstance.
1188,"I love this app! It makes saving money so easy. I never miss it, and it adds up fast!"
1189,I love the fact it takes out money on my behalf by itself so I will not have to put it in there... because if I would have don't it. I know I would be picky and put very minimal or not put nothing at all
1190,"Great app, really lets you forget about it and next thing you know, you've got alot of extra play money"
1191,Digit has helped me to save money with ease. I have been very happy with my experience. I never thought I would be able to save like this.
1192,"Blindly saving money without even realizing its missing, you can't beat that!"
1193,Great app. Withdrawals happen quickly and when I had to close my account I got my money really fast!
1194,"Helps us save without thinking about it. And when we need some extra cash, its fast and easy to grab it from our digit account."
1195,Digit makes saving easy and pain free! I like the automatic savings and withdrawals back into my checking account.
1196,This app is really good in helping you save and keep your account from having overdraft fee.
1197,Perfect for quick savings! Had hundreds saved before I knew it and was the perfect account to use for xmas
1198,I love this app. It helps me save money so effortlessly. It's been a lifesaver.
1199,Effortless way to save money and super easy to take money out. I reccomend this app to all my friends
1200,Great experience with Digit. It's automated my savings and saved me on moments of judgment.
1201,"Had to change my review. They helped me saved a nice amount and pay down some debt. I would've stayed with it, if the price didn't change on me."
1202,Saving money without you even noticing is awesome. And it's an easy way to save.
1203,"Very helpful, I can with draw from rainy day instead of from my savings"
1204,helps keep me in the know about my money and i honestly love having that rainy day savings. suuuper useful app!
1205,Digit makes saving money so incredibly easy. I highly recommend this app.
1206,Great app that has actually helped me save money for the first time!
1207,Great way to teach kids and adults how to save money.
1208,Perfect tool for forced savings..set and forget.
1209,Love Digit! A user friendly method of stashing away money to build savings.
1210,Perfect app to help you save money even if it's for a specific goal
1211,Incredible app. Has helped me save money for so many dumb things.
1212,I have been using this for 2 years and it has helped me save for literally everything.
1213,I love all of the updates I get from my bank ! Great app
1214,Love this app . üëè it really help save money for extra things.
1215,Digit has helped me save money without even have to stress or worry. Super easy-to-use
1216,This app is there for when you need it the most. Great savings tool indeed.
1217,Super easy to use and great for saving!
1218,Awesome app and it's flexibility makes it perfect.
1219,This is a great app. Saving has never been easier.
1220,I love this app its so helpfulness those who struggle like myself with finances
1221,"It works perfectly! Very easy to use, clear and reasonable instructions, I can choose the amount to be saved daily, weekly or, monthly. It will then, automatically withdrawal that amount from my primary checking account. Making it ever so easy to accomplish any and all of my saving goals! Tomorrow, for the first time, I'm buying a brand new truck CASH! Thanks digit!"
1222,"I love digit! I like to set it up and hide the app from myself for a few months at a time. Been using it for a couple years now and saved a lot more money than i expected from myself. the daily balance checks are more consistent than my bank. And most importantly, the overdraft protection lives up to the PROTECTION part of its name, couldnt reccomend it enough. If you're the type who had a hard time keeping a savings account, this app is for you."
1223,"Ok hear me out saving money takes discipline. It requires you to set aside money that you would normally spend frivolously. Digit makes it so easy to set the money aside,you just have to do your part and keep it there. Since I've started saving with digit I went from a place where I was scraping by from check to check. Last month I lost track of my pay day, because I wasn't worried about cash!!! That was such an amazing feeling! Thank you digit!"
1224,Really been saving my money and I didn't check on it for 3 months. Great app
1225,"I've had this app for over 2 months now and I must say it's like magic. I never notice when it pulls money out (Im not micro-managing it either). I like how you can set different goals like for a vacation or new car, phone bill etc... After the first few weeks I'm like ""hmmm, I wonder if it has worked?"" I checked and had over 200 bucks saved and that's when I was sold. Deff worth the $5 a month üíØ üôå UPDATE: Apr 16th '21 Vacationed twice already from Digit and about to start my 3rd. üå¥ ‚òÄ üòé"
1226,Really makes it easy to save money without thinking about it!!!
1227,Last month i had 200.79 on my card. I then made a payment to my discover card i dont see any transaction. What happend to the $200.79???
1228,Amazing! I love Digit. It saves money for me and I am able to withdraw it at any time. I love that I can save for multiple goals. I can even save faster for a particular goal. I've been with Digit for over a year now and have had no technical issues. Thank you Digit for helping me to save money for me and my family.
1229,Great app! Saves me Money without having to think about it.
1230,"I like it. A lot of thought was put into this so you can save -- with ease -- at a steady, tailored rate. the Overdraft Protection is a feature that doesn't matter... until it does. It's the Truth!!!!! All in all, I approve Digit, try it"
1231,Pretty great. I've been managing to save $300 per month. It has been encouraging to see nearly $1000 saved in 3 months. Definitely worth the $5 service fee to force me into a beneficial habit. Saving and then investing and earning has become more addictive than spending.
1232,Love how easy it is for me to transfer and save money.
1233,Love it. Put my kids on to it. Have saved so much money without even feeling or noticing it being gone. If you think you can't afford save to anything this app will show you different. How you feel when you check the app and see your financial goals growing is indescribable. I'm glad I found it.
1234,"Such an easy app to use! It keeps the guesswork out of saving and helps me make better decisions when saving money. I barely notice the money leaving my checking account, but the savings add up quickly! I'm super happy with the results!"
1235,"Man it's a great way to put money back. I forgot I had this app to be honest, just so happened to open it today and saw I had an extra 10.00. Doesn't seem like alot I know, but it's the principle of how the pocket change added up automatically."
1236,"Absolutely loving it!! Just what I was looking for! I needed a way to save $$ every day (I'm a Gig Worker and get paid daily) because I'm super bad at it and money burns a hole in my pocket immediately! So this allows me to put a little away into as many different mini savings as I need. Car payment, insurance, phone bill, fun money, rainy day... Etc. Depending on your preferences, you can allow it to take some money, from your account, in small increments so you don't notice so much. ‚ù£Ô∏è"
1237,"I have saved quite a bit of money using this app, and it was effortless."
1238,I love it! It helps me save money towards many goals!
1239,Love Digit! Helps me save money without even thinking about it.
1240,Great app. Really helps save towards goals without even thinking about it much. Only issue I've encountered in the past was a disconnect issue if you used a smaller bank or prepaid card. Other than that it's great.
1241,So neat that I can save without thinking about it! I've already reached a goal to buy samples for my business. They even put money in your account from the rainy day fund when your bank balance goes below a certain amount.
1242,Digit is wonderful. Best decision I made to help me with my finances!
1243,Great app for busy people that don't save as they should
1244,This is honestly one of the best apps. It is easy to use and understand. I love being able to choose savings goals and set limits on daily savings. The extra payments to my credit card and school loan is a great feature. Only thing I would like to see implemented is the ability to make extra payments to loans from retirement accounts. I saved more money using this app since January than I ever did. Best 5 dollars spent a month and hope they don't raise that fee!
1245,The best app to save and budget and get out of date
1246,"Awesome app, saved so much money."
1247,This is the easiest way to save a little money here and there.
1248,"AMAZED by how quickly I meet my goals ! I don't even realize I'm saving as its taken out frequently but in small amounts over a period of time I chose to reach each goal. And lS if magic, the funds I need appear when I need them ... out of the air! I'll be landscaping, putting in a pool with a deck and fencing it in soon ! THANKS TO DIGIT ! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DIGIT TO EVERYONE !"
1249,"Really easy to save. I dont miss the money saved because sometimes it's literally pennies. Great app for ppl who want to save but don't think they have ""enough money"" to start."
1250,It's great to save money and not really notice it! Money is automatically saved for you. You can withdraw when you want and how much you want. Totally happy I signed in with Digit!
1251,I love this app! Helps me save without even thinking about it.
1252,"Great app, great setup, and good costumers care. I truly recommend Digit"
1253,Awesome way to save effortlessly
1254,I love how much I save passively!
1255,Easy to save with this app. Easy to understand. There is one feature I wish it had. To give YES or NO txt option when depositing money from overdraft protection/rainy day fund into account. Several times I went under set amount but was getting paid the next day. I would have declined the withdrawal from rainy day fund if given option. Still love the app though.
1256,"Blindly saving money without even realizing its missing, you can't beat that!"
1257,Very easy to use
1258,I love the fact it takes out money on my behalf by itself so I will not have to put it in there... because if I would have don't it. I know I would be picky and put very minimal or not put nothing at all
1259,This is the easiest way to save a little money here and there.
1260,"So far everything is working great. It does take money out in pretty big chunks but its money I honestly barely notice leaving anyways, better to go into a savings account than be spent on gas station food or something."
1261,This app is great! I used it to save up a bit of money over a period of time. I got let go from my job and luckily had enough funds to pay off my bills until I got a new job. Definitely keeping this app!
1262,I love this app its so helpfulness those who struggle like myself with finances
1263,Easy way to save money!
1264,I have been using this for 2 years and it has helped me save for literally everything.
1265,I forgot i had this app on my phone but it did not forget to save for me! Deff keeping it.
1266,Great app
1267,Great way to save
1268,Easy way to save!
1269,Great app that has actually helped me save money for the first time!
1270,I find this app very helpful and you can manage your money safely and invest on daily basis that is wonderful. I only wish that the money I put on my rainy day saving one day they can give access to invest it automatically and have profit on it too.
1271,Nice way to save money
1272,I dont know how but this app manages to squirrel away money for me without missing it. Withdrawing money is easy and fast too.
1273,My saving game is way stronger now than it was before. %100 recommend
1274,Great way to save!
1275,"This is a class act app,I didn't really know what it would do when I signed up but after them saving my account from being overdrawn I was really impressed I kept seeing + amounts from digit I was like wow they just seemed to be pouring money into my account to keep in a positive state,they also can invest for you set up retirement and more!! Great!!"
1276,"I LOVE THIS APP!!!! I literally do not know what I would do without it. If you need help saving for certain things, paying off credit cards sooner, not to mention paying your phone bill every month Get this app!!"
1277,Help me save without even thinking bout it. Love it!
1278,Awesome helps me save lots of money that would otherwise be spent on junk.
1279,Great
1280,"Love it,its like my sneaky ninja money saver"
1281,I got lock out of my act with almost a 1000 in there. I need help
1282,I disable my alerts and this becomes out of sight out of mind. Thank you Digit
1283,"Saves money for you with out you worrieing about remembering to save. It sends your money back to you when it sees your under a certain amount. Only down fall is its not instant, weather it's sending money cause your low or you ask to withdrawal it, it takes a day or two to get the money, good so you have to wait and rethink your purchase, bad if you need the money now. It also wont take anymoney out if you ynder a certain amount so it wont make you broke while trying to save money."
1284,"It's very easy to save, no effort on your part. Learns your spending habits so the app knows if it can save or not. I've been using this since it was released and I highly recommend it"
1285,Love it
1286,"Great savings app to help you mindlessly save for anything, and keeps you from spending your savings impulsively."
1287,Helps me save so much!
1288,Great for saving!! Has really helped me!

1296,This makes it easy to save or for something special it's a no brainer you don't even miss it
1297,I love all of the updates I get from my bank ! Great app

1304,Great
1305,"Love the app, helps me save"
1306,"Best savings app I've ever had. I am OCD when it comes to my money and how I want it saved. You can have as many savings groups as you want, it NEVER over drafts you, and you can withdraw at any point. It's a 90/10 for me. I will have this app for a long time."
1307,Love Digit! Helps me save money without even thinking about it.
1308,Awesome
1309,Great app to have if you're trying to save money
1310,"The only time I've ever saved money!! This is the easiest app to use and you can control everything. How much it transfers, if your account drops below a certain amount it won't touch it, U can set a max daily amount for it to save for you. It's the best! My daughter and I have saved over a thousand dollars in the last 6 months of using this and that never would've happened if we'd have been just trying to save ourselves"
1311,Reliable app
1312,I love this app. Saves for me keeps me updated. Less logins for me to check on my accounts.
1313,Great App
1314,I love how it squirrels away money and I don't even miss it!
1315,Great app I just set it up and it does the rest. Never been able to really save before but this makes it easy.

1328,Digit is wonderful. Best decision I made to help me with my finances!
1329,Makes me save! I love it.
1330,The best app to save and budget and get out of date
1331,Good app
1332,Great app. Easy way to save up money or credit payments made automatically.
1333,"Holds my finances together, never saved more than a few hundred in my life before digit. Close to 40k now and their investments are doing grear."
1334,"Awesome app, saved so much money."
1335,Forces one to save. Amazing!
1336,Best saving app!
1337,Been usingnthis app since 2018..goals always accomplished
1338,Convenient and fabulous.
1339,Digit makes saving money so incredibly easy. I highly recommend this app.
1340,Saving money without you even noticing is awesome. And it's an easy way to save.
1341,Great app.
1342,This is the type of saving that works for me. I get nervous to move hug chunks of money at once out of my checking account into saving. So moving little by little into my savings account is what works for me! 2k in retirement and 6k in savings in 6 months?! Ok!!
1343,Great app.. very useful
1344,Perfect way to manage money
1345,Great....
1346,Pretty cool.
1347,Great savings tool
1348,Really good app
1349,"I actually forgot that I had this money being saved. Being able to come and utilize it in a time of need, is awesome! I like that its saving for me, without worry!"
1350,Love everything about Digit
1351,An exceptionally easy way to save!
1352,Pretty bad ace. I always get up to 150 each time. And as soon as I pay it off it becomes available again. You can't set up pay dates or if you can it can be.. well not up front. You'd have to chat with customer service to ask for an extension but I haven't done that much or at all. One thing though is it automatically takes whatever money you have on due date and after if not paid in full. Also one Last thing is the instant fee is like 4.99 for 150 for me. Not bad at all. I recommend
1353,This'll be the third time that I tried to do the Albert app and it finally worked with my chime account granted they probably start the cash advance at a small amount until they see that you're going to repay them because of all the people that probably abused these things but so far so good I like that you don't have to pay for the genius account until next month so you can see what it's about and they're already sending a debit card for me
1354,I've had the Albert app for a while but just recently started using it as intended. It actually is helping me save money. I am doing the 'Smart Savings' schedule which saves small amounts throughout the week. It analyzes your spending which I find very helpful because I wouldn't spend the time to do that normally. Makes you look at what your spending! Never had any issues that have required customer service so can't speak on that. I think it's a good app overall. I'm sure it will get better!
1355,I love Albert. Anytime and Everytime I needed so e extra funds. This app was very helpful. I forgot a payment and they suspended my account I stead of closing my account . And then I was back to normal and able to borrow if I ever needed again. I'm like other apps. They completely shut u down.
1356,Love that once you pay it back you can do it again if need be immediately or the next day. Great app to use if need a quick 50 or so just wish i could get bigger advances but hey they are helping when im in need! Cant complain about that! great App! Thanks Albert!
1357,I like Albert the people who complain seem to not check their settings they just seem to set up the account and think it's all ready to go you got to adjust things with everything the same way I like the genius even though I haven't really gotten into it seems like it has some benefits way to go guys at Albert I appreciate the hard work to make a great app
1358,"I'll be honest, at first I was frustrated because I needed to use the Instant Cash feature right away, but I kept having an issue with getting it. But the wait was worth it and Albert is definitely a keeper!"
1359,"I don't remember how I found this app but now that I have it's staying! Albert automatically takes money from your acct.& puts it in a savings for you. It's been a couple of weeks & I already have a little over $100. Can complain about that! EDITED 6/25/21 - Love Albert & whoever invented it, lol!! But seriously, everything is so simple & effortless. Just link your account & you're off to the races. If your leary - me too at first - start slowly & go from there. You won't be disappointed."
1360,I was first confused about certain aspects of policy but the Genius team helped me understand everything completely and in a very timely manner. I originally had a bad review but it had def been cleared up and 5 stars all the way
1361,For about 9 months I've been using Albert because of the pandemic I started off with $25 as my advance and $25 goes a long way when you're laid off of work and I paid on time and slowly they have increased my advance and I've had nothing but great experiences with them
1362,"So far, so good. I like this app a little better than a couple of other loan ones that I have on my phone. It would be nice if they let you adjust your repayment date through the app once in awhile but I can't complain. They've never taken it out when I didn't expect it like some other apps... overall I would say I'm happy with it. üòã and I don't really leave reviews üòÅ"
1363,Easy to use. Also an optional savings tool. And the smaller amounts are a nice touch. Sometimes you don't always need to borrow a 100
1364,Fast easy and money is there in a few minutes I recommend that friends and family easy to set up easy to manage and helps a lot when you're in a bind need a few extra bucks and they do so much more too
1365,I felt I needed to leave a review after reading negative reviews about customer service. I experienced an issue stating I was in eligible and I was afraid I wouldn't get help because reviews say customer service never answered but I sent a text and a few hours I had a response and in just a few more hours the advance was again eligible. Been with Albert almost seven months and only had the one issue and the response of customer service was great. Thanks Albert.
1366,"I am so happy and satisfied with the first impressions of Albert!! Looking forward to working with Albert with the set up Super Super Simple, helpful and Quick!! Thank you!"
1367,"This app simply works, meaning it simple to work, it's not over complicated, there's no ""fine print"" recommend also when the green jar is empty, this helps fix that"
1368,Great app! Have never had a problem with it and my favorite feature is the saving feature! It really helps me save
1369,"This is my husbands ggogle account but i enjoy using alberr. Once u set up your banking info and you get approved, it is a VERY PAINLESS PROCEES. Yoy need a steady income and at least 2 dollars for verification by Albert. This app is just as good if not better than DAVE and Money Lion. App east to use, not over engineered and NO BUGS! I was able to borrow $25 once bank account was verified. Very convenient and I feel better knowing if u get into a pinch before payday that I can turn to the app"
1370,"It takes small amounts of money and puts it away in a savings account. It takes small withdrawals and you don't even feel it. You can even set up individual saving goals for anything you need such a vacations, rainy day, etc."
1371,"Great for tracking spending patterns , maintaining budgets and easy cash advances gives a little peace of mind."
1372,I love love love this app!!! It has gotten me through Many Rough times! Kudo's to You for a job well done!
1373,This App has the best platform & the A.I Bot Is A Neat Feature As Well. I Just Tried Out The Advance Option Available & The Money Was Deposited Instantly Into My Bank Account. This Is my New $$$ App. Well Done Albert
1374,"Only took minutes to get the cash advanced I asked for! Very easy, only took minutes to apply any get my cash advance! Wonderful app"
1375,"This really is an amazing app. It allows you to see all of your financial information in one place. Including property, bank statements, loans, investments and even has an option to loan you a few bucks until payday!! This app has helped me in so many ways I can't say thank you enough to the team who created and works on this app to make everything go so smoothly and assist you in anyway you need. Thank you Albert!"
1376,Really works!! Fee free advance in 3 days or pay $5 for access immediately. Love this app!!
1377,It's a very helpful app especially when that extra cash is needed for a rainy day. Other features are the budgeting and the rainy day fund as well as the investing feature that are very helpful to help you stay on track with finances.
1378,It was fairly easy to set up the account. Everything in one account. Simple and secure.
1379,"This is a really easy app to use, the people are easy to talk to and understand. This is a great app I really enjoy using it"
1380,I have to say anytime I send a message they respond no matter what.... they have help with so rough times and always more them willing to help I wish the advance was a little more but completely understand why they set the limit
1381,Albert is a very simple to use but they go deep on your finances to be sure you are NOT getting ripped off or taken advantage of. You pay what you think is fair or nothing at all. It's worth every penny that you choose to pay. I highly recommend this app to get your financial self in order.
1382,"This app is a blessing! It can help you save money, plan, and improve your credit score. I highly recommend!!"
1383,No complaints. I bank with Chime and so many of these payday advance apps don't accept Chime as a bank they do business with... Extra star for that
1384,I have been using Albert for around a year and it has saved the day many times !! I am a new grandma so when I get that call from my kids for diapers or milk or gas .. whatever .. the ability to get an advance really helps cause I can't say no and end up short on MY stuff sometimes.. this past year has caused paycheck to paycheck life and it looks like it's gonna get harder but Albert is a little cushion ..thnx
1385,"The app does everything that's listed in the description and MORE!!! So far so good üòÅ and I have NO üôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è complaints whatsoever thus far.. I recently applied for the cash advance that is advertised at $100. Needless to say that I was a little disappointed when they informed me that I was only eligible for an advance of $25 with a $3.99 INSTANT advance fee or the alternative which was to receive the advance for free but within 3-5 business days. I am grateful regardless, thank you again ALBERT"
1386,Another nice little financial app. These apps aren't out to fleece people. They are actually helping people get through this difficult time.
1387,Easy to sign up! The only thing that may hold you up is it depends on your own financial institution to verify the functionality of this app before you find out if you qualify for a cash advance. I signed up in the afternoon and it took about 6 hours but I was approved for the advance and its Saturday! Im very pleased with this app and the customer service! Highly recommend this app to anyone who is looking for a cash advance!
1388,Never have problems with it and it's very helpful with saving money and showing where I spend money.
1389,"Fixed! Took awhile but they fixed the issues and now it works great. Couldn't even get set up, because they see my income as an expense versus an income, even with screenshots and paystubs. Extremely bothersome they can override an error that's the difference between a plus and a minus and thousands of dollars. It makes no sense."
1390,Great app with a lot of good information about money and services.
1391,Great budget app with a bank you can use and you can also advance on your paycheck with minimum repayment charges
1392,Easy simple. Needed cash fast for an emergency. Very excited to be able to connect with financial experts and put some money aside.
1393,This App has awesome customer service. Hubby and I love it.
1394,I love this app. I've been able to save money and keep my finances inline very easily. I love the auto savings it does. I just set it and forget it and watch savings grow. The investment feature is pretty sweet to. Simple to use and just all around a great app. Give it a try you'll like it.
1395,"Albert is a great app. It works like it's supposed to. The customer service is probably the best around. They are prompt responding to questions or concerns. My advance limit has been raised several times without me even asking. It's pretty simple, as long as you pay back advances this app will be there when you need it."
1396,"I love this app. Anytime i need help they're always there! Only thing I dont like is that they decide the amounts, which sometimes is an inconvenience when I need more money and there's nothing I can do! Other than that, great for quick low cash amounts."
1397,It's been pretty good even though you're only allowed to borrow up to 25 which I feel is very low it helps when you need an extra bit of cash in between paydays this is the one payday advance app I've never had an issue with and also helps you invest some of your money and help budget although you should be able to do that on your own having an app that helps you with that just makes things that much easier I highly suggest checking it out compared to most of the other ones out there seriouslü§ô
1398,Excellent app excellent customer service. Always courteous to my husband.
1399,Super easy to set up. Instant cash is a plus!
1400,The Albert App is Great!!! Helps saving money really easy. And they are their to benefit you and no one else. I definitely give Albert and the App 5 star all day long and Twice on Sunday's!!!!
1401,Super easy to set up and I was eligible for a small advance within minutes!
1402,"I love this app, it gives me a chance to get some cash here and there and then pay it back next check. I also like that it helps me save here and there. I recommend it for someone who has issues with spending money."
1403,I love this app. It's so easy to use. I don't even have to think about it. The money goes into my savings and my investments accounts. I also like the alerts I get about my spending as well as the end of the month reviews. I can see where I've over spent and make necessary adjustments.
1404,Great App! I enjoy the articles and the way it helps with my budget
1405,I love this app it definitely helps when your in a bind and you need quick cash
1406,"I loveee this app!!! Keeps you abrest of everything. Makes suggestions based in your income and how to increase. I loves how it keeps me informesd of frequent purchases at stores i go to, so that i can make adjustments accordingly. It looks for ways to save money and put it in your acct"
1407,"So far, It has a lot of really useful features that I am just beginning to explore...will update later but as if now I am very optimistic about this app."
1408,I was having trouble with my banking informatiin updating. Once I reached out to get assistance it was handled promptly and all issues were corrected. I would recommend this to friends and family.
1409,"Best APP ever!, No glitches, informative keeps me in check with all accounts and the investment engine works amazing. Also it saves money you don't even miss."
1410,"This is an update. Customer service does get back to you in a timely manner. I like the way they talk to you through text, also if they need anything they will ask you for a screenshot and you can send it via email. Albert thank you you have got me out of some tight spots"
1411,I love this app! The automatic savings feature is fantastic. The one downside was if I needed funds immediately but I'm guessing the addition of their cash card may have fixed that. This app is the truth!!!
1412,"I promise you after the app confirms your information, it is a life saver for the weeks of shortness when that extra cash is needed. I love it and inexpensive to payback. It has allowed me to8p 00o save money without even noticing its fine but know I have a nest egg when I need it."
1413,"Seems like a great App so far. I've only had it for a few days and already the Geniuses are building my personal budget and giving me tips on how to manage, and even make, my money. After I linked all of my bank accounts and cards it allowed me to get an advance. So its definitely not an automatic thing but they clearly run their app professionally and it assures me that my money and information are safe."
1414,"Very helpful!! Wonderfully created app!! Highly recommend this!!! Update*** After awhile, you get an upgrade to larger amounts if you want so helpful!!! üò≤"
1415,I was able to ask questions and learn about budgets and saving for the future. Albert helped me every step of the way.
1416,The Albert App is truly an awesome App. It has helped me get to payday many times. I am just glad there is an App like this. You need to try it out if you have a recurring direct deposit and you can payback the advance on your paydate. Thanks Albert for your help.
1417,"I'm giving this app 5 stars solely for the support provided. They stay on their A game.. Unlike similar apps, if you take an advance and your paydate is different due to holidays, they will give you wiggle room and change the payback to your actual paydate."
1418,Really works simple and fast manages your budget for u...great app..
1419,Great app. Albert delivers great services for the free edition. I prefer them over Dave. Their mandatory $1 fee is dumb and you don't have to pay that with Albert. Repaying advances is a flat $5.
1420,Works great just wish the instant cash amount was more then $25 all the time. I dont understand why it always says instant cash not available when my money is always there every 2 wks but has to validate it everytime
1421,"GREAT SITE TO USE!! Cash advances increase with each advance paid back on time!! Advances are deposited into your bank account within minutes!! Fixes your immediate ""pickle"" and gives you time to pay it back!!"
1422,Honestly a great app far more reliable than Dave in my current experience the app as a whole is more user friendly I would definitely suggest it for anyone looking for cash advances
1423,Fast and easy......Albert is there to say the day whoever you overdraw your account.....a great lifesaver.....one simple request and a small fee for instant transfer into your account....its that simple......try it and I know you'll be glad you did.
1424,Very good app and very helpful when you need a little extra to get through till PayDay. I really love this app. Thank you so much for the help!!! Absolutely AMAZING!!!
1425,"App really does what it says, they monitor your spending and tell you where you can improve and allow instant borrowing, work with them a bit and you can borrow more and more!! It really helps for random bills you weren't expecting."
1426,I really enjoy this app. Its an easy fast way to get a little help when finances are tight and running low. I recommend this app to anyone who wants a one stop app for pay money advances and investing. Also the the customer service is excellent and they resolve any issue your having with the app fast and hassle free. Also when you apply for an advance they send you the money fast no waiting around. Keep up the good work Team Albert and thank you for everything you do.
1427,User friendly & a wide variety of financial options.
1428,Very nice to have the ability to get a little extra cash to get you through to your next payday or just have a couple extra bucks to buy something cool for yourself instead of waiting. Very convenient.
1429,Awesome experience though I know that my income level and bills should very well allow me a larger advance then just a 50 dollar maximum but nonetheless a good app for more then just needing an advance great for retirement planning and investing as well.
1430,"Love using Albert. When I have a good amount in the bank, they transfer to my rainy day fund. When I need it, it's there, and if I need a small advance, I can get that too. Thanks Albert."
1431,Absolutely the very best. They're spot on with everything they say! Wouldn't change them for the world.#theverybest! You're able to borrow smaller amounts which in return makes it so easy to pay back üòò
1432,"In today's world where everything is a subscription service, Albert really helps break everything down so you know how much your spending and when. In an easy to view app."
1433,Great app. I love how it tells what I've spent. I also luke the tips and suggestion it always give me.
1434,"Aside from charging the repayment a little early in the morning, Albert stands above other undependable fintech apps and works for me just as advertised, with fair fees. Keep it up!"
1435,Everyone who can should try this app comes in real handy when you need the money for The extra gas or food when you're in a pinch they think it's a real good app comes in very handy in they teach you a lot if you willing to listen and follow what they say
1436,I am so happy to have Albert. Everytime I run short on my funds they are there to help. Since I have downloaded the app I have not been stuck because of them. With very little payback. I mean 2 something. I would recommend this app to anyone. They can also help with finances..investments and saving money. They are amaZing!! THANK YOU ALBERT! It is an amazing g thing you do for people and I am truly grateful!!
1437,"So helpful in every way. Geniuses are always on point. And my Fav is the auto save option. Before you even realize what's going on, there's a couple hundred bucks in your savings and investing accounts. Love Albert"
1438,"Great app to have, helps me track my spending while saving money! Also decided to invest a little, but main focus is saving. Albert makes it pain free and is very informative!"
1439,At first i was really skeptical about their services and didnt quite understand what they offered. But now that I understand how they operate. This app and the Genius's are amazing!!!!
1440,"This App is AWESOME, coolnto dabble in getting your feet wet with investing and FANTASTIC in being able to SAVE $$$$$ . Cash is withdrawn from whatever financial instituion of your choosing and the next thing you know you have 2K+ saved!! U can set ur savings goal and bam, the $$$ starts to flow in and BAM U SAVED $$$$$"
1441,"Wow, Albert is so easy to register and get going for all my needs. Highly recommend Albert to anyone wanting to start saving for a better future."
1442,"Great app. Helps be see where my money is going, where I could be saving. And the cash advance is handy in a pinch."

1445,I love ALBERT!!! This app is wonderful!!! It's always there when you need help with anything
1446,"So far all us well. I've yet to invest anything but I've deposited $ in account and everything is real user friendly. Have not had to converse with customer service andv3v thats a plus!!! Update: 5-7-21, the app is decent i put a lil $ weekly for savings and its automatic, put a lil in to the investing side and its up. Im able to withdraw up to $75 regardless of funds in my acccgctccount for free"
1447,App is easy to use and navigate very impressed.
1448,Love this app so much!! Has really helped out this month!!
1449,I've had this app for quite some time now. It's a great app. Tells me what I spend how much I spend saves me money because I set it up that way. Asks me on occasions if I wanna save more money. It's a great app
1450,"Ok, ok, ok I can admit when I was wrong. I do sincerely apologize cause I was struggling with transferring existing account with new phone. I have to admit it was my fault, I signed in with the wrong email. But support stepped in and we worked together over several hours until my issue was resolved. I do thank you for prompt and quick and also assisting me with resolving my issue. 50 STARS"

1519,Really works!! Fee free advance in 3 days or pay $5 for access immediately. Love this app!!
1520,This'll be the third time that I tried to do the Albert app and it finally worked with my chime account granted they probably start the cash advance at a small amount until they see that you're going to repay them because of all the people that probably abused these things but so far so good I like that you don't have to pay for the genius account until next month so you can see what it's about and they're already sending a debit card for me
1521,Great
1522,"This is literally one of the best financial apps I have ever seen. Talk about caring for one's financial well being! Great job you guys, make me feel a lot better about not being the only individual who genuinely cares about our world and community/family and their well being as a whole. Not just out to get a buck!

1549,Bank set up
1550,This os an easy save app but also provides financial tools for learning how to budget buy homes invest and utiluze your money.
1551,Love
1552,Great way to figure where you are and where you want to be in life. Great work Nerdwallet excellent app. I really appreciate the time an effort that was done in making this app a masterpiece on setting goals financial.
1553,"UPDATE: They fixed it, and it works just fine right now. And the customer service/tech support rep was fantastic. ORIGINAL: Since the last update, the app just asks me to link to my accounts and then when I try to relink it tells me they're already linked and to try another account which it then tells me I've already linked to... and it's an infinite loop. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and so on. So, I'd say NerdWallet is a cool service, the app is terrible."
1554,"Love it! Easy to use and actually extremely helpful, unlike many other similar apps. This one's different, 100% does what's promised if you apply the knowledge given and take time to click on provided links/resources. Also love the design and interface is just amazing as well. Don't give 5 stars much but this app and Self are the two 5 stars I highly recommend for getting finances and credit on track!"
1555,"To put plain and simple, after I open the app I couldn't put it down. I was in it for 4 hours before I looked up. The tools, tips, and financial advice is unlimited. I actually downloaded the app for advice on how to get rewards and cash back from my debit and bank cards. I got a lot more than what I bargined for. The app is literally a college level financial course, a budget guide, and a financial advisor balled in to an app."
1556,NerdWallet actually gives me a sense of my finances and how to manage them. I appreciate the guides and tips as well! I find the app very useful and I would highly recommend it.
1557,"You can read about and learn finances,credit scores,taxes and much more.NerdWallet has everything you need to make better informed decisions with their updated,reliable information. I love using this user friendly app.Highly recommend it.Thanks NerdWallet.YOU ROCK!!"
1558,Very good way to monitor and improve credit rating. Very informative! I'm always learning beneficial tidbits.
1559,I like nerd wallet it simple format is easy to follow and it has really helped me get a handle on my finances. Now I feel like I'm in control. All thanks to Nerd wallet.....
1560,"Omg, wish I had known sooner. Only problem can't get my credit union Bank to connect. So I'll keep trying, other than that. Everyone should be using this app."
1561,"Simple yet secure setup, easy to install, important info to know is shared along with helpful tips!"
1562,Quick account reporting. App does instruct you how to build and monitor your credit. Good app!
1563,Very helpful to me including that its been very hard for me too open my accounts its always one thing or another
1564,"I'm 51yrs old, I didn't understand how important establishing credit was when I was young, so I avoided it. Plus, I was afraid of getting in debt, so I assumed paying cash for nearly everything would suffice. I was wrong, although not getting in debt was great it wasn't practical. For almost 3yrs I've been trying to establish credit. I use 3 free sites to gain knowledge upon how to achieve credit excellence. Nerdwallet is the (3rd) most recent site, and truly has the most accurate information."
1565,I've been working on rebuilding my credit for the last year. This app has been a great tool in helping me take charge of something that always seemed out of my control. It's an hugely empowering feeling!
1566,"Very happy with the app, especially the credit simulator that it has! Highly recommend to anyone looking to monitor their credit and nurse it back to health!"
1567,Some of the best financial data out there in an easy understandable interface. One of my favorite things is to look at is the compound interest calculator and the credit card comparing tool. If you're a financial nerd like myself and love being able to get $0.25 off the gallon from using cash back and other tools this is the place to look.
1568,I love how descriptive and knowledgeable about every area revolving around credit. They give the best suggestions to how to help you build your credit back up and the best ways to become debt free by offering steps to do so. They always have the best resources!! I totally recommend people to them and I love the app!!
1569,"Unlike credit krampa, this has thorough useful information and tools to improve your credit score. Deep amount of recommendations for credit cards. Credit score tool to see how your score changes in response to things like a new credit card. Very useful. After 4 months I was able to boost my credit score by 88 points."
1570,"So far so good, its really great to know whats going on behind the scenes as far as My credit is concerned! I like the the App Very Much! Thank You! No not that one"
1571,Very useful. Provides info and accuracy. Makes it easier on the smaller businesses and advertisers to keep an eyes and track their credit. Thanks Nerd Wallet!
1572,"Excellent App! NerdWallet is one of the most resourceful apps out there as far as keeping you updated on your credit. The constant news updates, info, and recommendations are how I was able to build my credit back up. So even if you use other apps to help you track your credit score I high recommend downloading NerdWallet also."
1573,"I just started using this app and found that all my finances were accurate. Their tips are helpful. I wish I knew just how helpful this app was sooner. It is easy to use and accurate. I have told friends about NerdWallet and they too love it. Give it a try, I'm confident it will be very useful!"
1574,Accidently hit dissatisfied on their survey just now! üò± I wish I could go fix it because this app is REALLY REALLY helpful! I especially appreciate the thought they put into every detail. It makes this app interesting and worth while! Thank you to the creators! -Kat
1575,I have been using the app for about two weeks makes it easy to setup my finances and budget accordingly especially like the fact that it sets up my bills on a schedule and the cash flow allows you to see how much your spending on certain items and even sperates them into categories for you 10 out of 10 would recommend for any beginning budget people
1576,Nerdwallet does a great job monitoring my credit. I'd get more rewards if I could just remember to use my debit cards as credit instead of using my pin.
1577,"""Nerd Wallet"" seems to be ""carving out"" a piece of the ""internet pie"" for themselves - in My Opinion, because They focus on much needed Important topics & financial articles with precise, informative, & accurate Answers! That makes Them Trustworthy - in a Time of ""Tough Financial Decisions"" that are currently, constantly changing... sometimes Weekly or even Daily! Therefore, these Qualities make this a ""Must have"" App. Hopefully They Won't become ""Overly Greedy"" & ruin Themselves - So Far GREAT!"
1578,"I've been looking for an app to help me manage my finances, and although I had some good experiences with other apps, this is the one I've been looking for. It has all the features and functions to help you monitor your credit, accounts, and investments."
1579,Credit in the US is a completely artificial game. Nerd wallet helps me get a handle on how that game is played and get on top of it. I went from no credit history to 795 in 4 years using this app. Highly recommend.
1580,Excellent app. This has been a great help with managing my spending and monitoring my credit. I look forward each week to see if my credit score has improved!
1581,"Imo, it's like a better version of the Android version of the Mint app! Plus, it gives financial advice which is always nice for the uninformed."
1582,"This app is pretty easy to use and isn't excessive with ads or push notifications. I don't think I have been making the most of it, but that's more because I am sporadic with my use."
1583,I appreciate the app and what the devs are doing to try and help people understand how to use credit. Gives a nice snapshot of life and money.
1584,Great App!!! Keeps me up-to-date with my credit score in addition to giving me tips to improve my credit.
1585,It's nice having everything there to keep track of things easily. Been using the app for years now.
1586,"NW is more comprehensive the similar apps like Kredit karma, Experian and others. Best for card analysis and remarks. Seems scores are pretty accurate too. I like it and recommend this one."
1587,Easy to use and a great interface. Helps me to stay on top of my finances with easy to read analysis.
1588,"This is an extremely helpful tool for budgeting, sorting expenses, or keeping track of wealth."
1589,"Love this app, it shows you a complete picture of your finances, you can also hide accounts that you don't want to include in your net worth"
1590,"All in one, cash management, credit and lending, and securities. The only thing is to make a dark mode. Personal Finance tool."
1591,Very great app. Love the way it helps management of money and all the ways to help your money to grow and raise credit
1592,Good app to use it helps tell you what your credit score is and tells you ways to work on your credit. I prefer to use this App. It's terrific
1593,This App showed me that my transunion credit score was low/bad. It helped me investigate why and discovered fraudulent collection reports. They also helped me file a grievance with Transunion to fix it.
1594,"Has ways to help credit score. Everything's right there on the home screen. Credit score, cash flow, debt, and totals of accts"
1595,My experience has been great with Nerd Wallet besides the minor late notifications on my credit file for activity all has been good.
1596,"So far so good.. Seems pretty secure. You do have to give up info by linking your accounts, but I see the benefits to it. Great app!"
1597,Very helpful and informative to those who desire the expansion of their financial knowledge and prowess.
1598,"Love watching my balance dwindling.keeps me on track. Nerd Wallet has added so many new features, I love utilizing their site."
1599,"This is the ONLY App I can honestly say has made a SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE impact on my credit report! 570 to 704 in less than a year! No BS & you can't beat that ANYWHERE else! Believe you me people, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL! Right on guys! Keep up the great work!"
1600,Always on point and super simple to navigate and add your information!
1601,From what I can tell so far it's a good financial records tracking tool to help keep my information together and get good tips.
1602,"I like it because I can keep track of my accounts, spending, and credit all on one app. I also get financing tips too!"
1603,So convenient and makes all my monthly finances so easy to view and work with in one place!
1604,Love the app. Much better than most free apps to track your budget.
1605,"Very helpful and informational. Automatically tracks all spending and you can even choose which accounts to monitor in different ways. So glad I found this. I just got approved for a new credit card. After searching endlessly online for one, and wasn't lucky, Nerd Wallet used all my input information and recommended the best card for my specific category and spending habits. LOVE IT!"
1606,"Very informative on how to handle where you put your benji's. If you take time and actually read through the info they give you'll know you're rights in certain situations, and gain valuable knowledge. I downloaded it today and in an hour I've found ways to raise my credit, knowledge on how to handle debt collectors, and a couple other things. Definitely a solid app that is not trying to push your money into their wallet. 5 stars!"
1607,Pretty decent app. I prefer this one over many others? But my love uses a different one that he won't back away from as it helps with rebuilding in a very specific format
1608,"This app helped me research and get the best credit card for my situation. It also links to all your loans and accounts to give you a clear view of your credit, cash flow, net worth, and budget. A must have if you're about understanding your Financials."
1609,"Great, free helpful tool to help stay on top or even catch-up on your credit score. It provides me with all the tools to do so in a way I acty understand. Love it !"
1610,This app will truly help you put your financial situation in perspective. Full of helpful articles on any financial subject you can think of with quality information not tabloid info. I followed their advice and am now looking for a üè† since I have been pre-approved for a mortgage
1611,"This app was recommended by a friend and I have to say it is one of the best apps I have. I check this quite often. I started out with Poor credit. Even my own bank would not issue me a Secured credit card. But a credit card is what I needed to get credit. With NerdWallet, not only am I able to see where my credit score stands but it gives tips on how to improve it. I followed the recommendations. Found a secured credit card that did not do a credit check and use it only for gas. Pay it off once a month. My score went from Poor to Good. This app is a great way to keep track of your spending habits and helps you to set long term goals."
1612,I've found this app the most helpful out of any other financing app that I've tried using. After you input your bank/card info (you can even pick and choose what you want and don't want displayed; simply dont enter info you dont want to) the app displays your statements so you can keep track of all of your spendings within one app. The app also keeps track of your credit score so you always know what it is. This is a fantastic all-in-one app I'd recommend to anybody and everybody.
1613,"I used NerdWallet last year when I was looking for a new credit card. When I finally decided to start tracking my spending to get a handle on my finances, I returned. I love being able to see everything in one place. I'm much more likely to look at it all that way. And having the dashboard with graphs, recent spending, and upcoming bills means all I have to do is log in, and everything I need is right there."
1614,"Love the app, but at some point it stopped linking with Regions bank. Nothing I do will fix this so at this point it's become useless to me. I sure hope they fix this soon, I had just begun loving the application and using it daily. So know it won't work with Regions, such a shame.. UPDATE: Nerd wallet immediately reached out to me and resolved this issue like the pros that they are, 5 stars !!!!!!!"
1615,"Love this app and service! All financial apps have the potential to loose connection between banks for a variety of reasons, but I gotta say, it feels like I have the least amount of connection issues with Nerd Wallet. Plus, I love how much the UX has improved over the past few months in the app, making mobile banking more visually enjoyable."
1616,"UPDATE: After uninstalling and re-downloading the app twice, I can now login. Winslow was very helpful in assisting me. We were using Samsung Note 10s, so it might have something to do with that. Love this app now that it's fixed! OLD: I can't login to the app anymore. It says my email address and password are wrong, but I can log in on the computer just fine. I have even tried signing in with Google and it still doesn't work. It's doing the same thing with my fiance's app."
1617,"I love this app! I am a notoriously bad spender/ budget-er, and this app has helped me save more money than I ever had in a long time! It just takes a few moments to input your bills and such and then its thought-free from there! Thank you NerdWallet! Edit: I see a lot of low reviews for this application. I haven't had a bad experience with this app so far, and for being one of the only free budgeting applications available, I'd say this is wher it is at!"
1618,"Amazing free app that makes credit repair and so much more, accessible to the undereducated, me, and I want to say thanks for not selling my info like so many places do these days. Nate"
1619,"Love the app everything! I have started tracking increasing finances and my credit score extremely easily/effieciently. A few things I want as a user, much faster connection too the app. Better deals, overall its a great idea just needs better cards/bank suggestionsas they are ads. So you see the ones that pay, not the best ones for you. also want to be able too use multiple credit monitoring services in conjunction with the app. Also only data needed should be tracked. No data should be sold."
1620,"I am for once, finally acting like an adult and focusing on my credit (over the past year) and nerdwallet has been key in creating visibility and guidance. I have gone from 560 to 732 now, that is quite the jump and I did NOT think it would be this easy and and smooth. Experian is a little behind (702) but they will catch up soon enough. The card offers now are loaded with 12-14 months interest free for purchases and balance transfers. 14 months ago, they were all secured-card offers."
1621,"One of the best credit monitoring apps out there. This, combined with Credit Karma, gives you a fantastic overview of your overall credit health without charging you a dime like the other FICO credit monitoring apps. Just don't take the credit scores at face value. A 700 credit score on Nerdwallet does not mean you have a 700 when lenders look you up, but it WILL show you any delinquencies, missed payments, or chargeoffs, which is critical to know before applying for new credit."
1622,"Great app! It's easy to use and gives tons of info on your spending and debt management. Better than other apps I've used for similar things. I had an issue with two loans being mis-categorized as retirement accounts. I contacted support and they fixed the issue quickly, and real humans replied when I had further questions. I'm honestly very happy with this. My only question is how they make money, because there's no premium version or paid features?"
1623,"I love the updated app that allows you to hide certain accounts and transactions. Before this update, I never had an accurate accounting of my money because some transactions shifted the numbers, like cash withdrawals and deposits btw accounts and business accounts I manage but do not use for personal finance. With this update, I have a clear picture of my actual cash, savings, and spending. Along with the new credit stimulation feature, this app is a one stop shop toward financial freedom ."
1624,"The dashboard Helps me keep track of debt and savings pretty simple. I can save stuff in categories(mortage, essential, utility) for the most part it categories stuff automatically. Input your accounts (checking,saving,investments) from multiple accounts. Good articles to keep me on track of my finances. Overall I use this app daily if not weekly. Good tool to stay organized."
1625,This app has helped me realize spending habits which resulted in me saving money on needless purchases and subscriptions that were outdated. It also helped me improve my credit score by showing me what aspects of my credit I needed to work on. I love this app and check it every day it's like an accomplishment when I get notifications that my credit score increased or that my spending was less than it was in the previous month.. 10/10
1626,"Great app. This is the ONLY money monitoring app I have found that actually can connect to my bank! I've tried so many different apps but none of them supported my bank. I am so happy to have tried this now. So far so good! My only complaint is I cant seem to find a way to see a breakdown of my income, only my outgoing payments."
1627,"easy to use and a overall amazing app to help track money and understand where it disappears to! it can also help track your bills and keeps a total of how much they are combined, it's very efficient. it combines them into groups and it's good to see if anything unusual pops up because it's all named and broken down for you to see in it's own category. RECOMMEND COMPLETELY!!!"
1628,Love this app!! The knowledge they give and the advice as well as alerts for any changes in my report!!
1629,"This app has helped me get my credit on track. Sure it doesn't show you the other credit scores but the one they do show still got me on the low end of excellent üëçüèª. Sure they try and sell you credit cards, but theur advice and articles are on thr money. A bit of a learning curve on how to use the app l, but not enough to deter me from using it. I recommend this app üëåüèª"
1630,"I love this app! NerdWallet has become a good friend of mine. It reminds me how important it is to keep track of my credit score and by default, my spending. That score runs your life for better or worse and we all want better. I like getting automatic updates of my score and being able to see why it change. For example the tips on how changing your number of payments on your credit card monthly can help you pay down debt. There are lots of ways to learn and use the information, so try it!"
1631,This is the best financial app ever. It really does work for everything that it describes it to be and then some.. Your credit score is extremely accurate and shows you step by step on improving your credit score. depending your credit score theres even credit cards for your convenience. from unsecured to secured credit cards rated top 10 best for your credit worthiness. You must download this app right away. Stop listening to the gimmicks start to rely on the best. NerdWallet you wont be sorry.
1632,"In my experience, NerdWallet is surprisingly accurate. I mainly use it to track my CC expenses and credit score. There are some useful features to check other CC offers like short but insightful reads that may benefit you by raising your credit score or saving you money. These tips and information can go a long way in helping one understand money and finances. I will continue to use this app for the long run."
1633,"Something I will be keeping on my device and constantly checking, most of the woeld already has your information on file, this is just a tool that helps you keep track of what matters most, and it does a great job at it. My favorite feature is giving a break down of all your expenses from all accounts. If you're like me and you have more than one checking and savings, its nice that it keeps it all in one place with a good interface to go along."
1634,"Just switched from mint and I love the layout! Very easy to use with so many great features! The one complaint I have is that I wish it'd have a more in depth budgeting system, not just tips. Also I'm a seasonal worker, is there a way to set levels of income for different months on estimated income?"
1635,"This is hands down the best app on my phone. I wouldnt even bother with any of the competition. This app is accurately displays recent transactions allows you to link your account fast and easy with no problems and even if they get disconnected they re link immediately is the best spend tracking, budgeting, Bill tracking app out on the market.I never review anything this deserved kudos."
1636,I absolutely love this app! I wasn't sure what it was all about until I finally just downloaded it After I moved into a new house and i wanted to create a Budget plan That's when I realized that this app does much more than that It also gives you a birds eye view of your credit score. I would also say that out of all of the Credit apps nerd wallet is number one for me!
1637,So far so good. I linked all my bank accounts up quickly and then did the credit report where i was pleasantly surprised at the score that came back from transunion 744. The app Is a straight forward approach really trying to figure out where your spending and alerting you to subscriptions you might not have even known you where still paying on! Its a much better app then... Mint
1638,This application is very fast reliable and free. They notify you quickly when there's any changes to your credit and there are upgrade options. I have enjoyed the free version for the last year and I will most likely upgrade so I can get my full report. Really enjoyed this application and I will recommend it to anyone.
1639,"its a great platform to utilize all your all your funds into one place, its very user friendly, and that says alot in regards to my case. The customer service is outstanding seriously, thank you to all who work so hard for folks like myself. They listen and are very patient, everything you woukd want!!!"
1640,"This has been great so far! Significantly better than the credit karma app or TurboTax app, securely links multiple accounts with constant monitoring and notifications if anything changes. Plus credit building assistance through video tutorials, budgeting made easy with graphs and suggestions. Of course all while keeping your credit score up to date. Easy to setup and quick to get into a routine using."
1641,"Love this app! I already knew about the website years ago and loved using them to choose credit cards. But this app really is a step up. It helps me keep track of my credit score, see my accounts, how I'm spending money, home valuation details and it give me information about how to improve my credit."
1642,This app really helps with anything from monitoring your credit score to tracking how you are spending your money and so much more. Would recommend this app to anyone.
1643,"Amazing. This app has not only helped me to keep up with my credit score, but it has educated me on what credit is. It completely alleviated the stigma around the word ""credit"". My credit score has increased by 100+ points because of it.üôåüèæüôåüèæ"
1644,"I think Nerd Wallet is great. It let's you track and see your credit score. It also tells you where you need improvement and tips on building your credit score and how to maintain your credit score. How to deal with derogatory remarks. Nerd wallet is great I take it with me everywhere. That way I can always stay on top of things. Thanks Nerd Wallet. I would suggest one thing where it ask your thought on Nerd Wallet after you rate it,and give statement It won't let you answer the other questions."
1645,"By far the best budget app I've ever had. Cash, savings, and credit all in one place. I do sometimes have to refresh or reconnect my bank accounts but I think that an issue with my bank. Either way, it doesn't affect the experience at all. Great app"
1646,"My friend recommended this app to help me watch my larger expenses. It's been fantastic and has really helped me organize things and monitor my spending. It's already helped me track down a few unused, recurring subscriptions and seems to connect pretty seamlessly with other cards, apps, & banking accounts. Great app!"
1647,I love this app. It's simple. I love everything about this app. The structure. The fact that everytime i open i see my updated credit score. My credit score isn't great so the fact they offer me ways to raise all on the home screen is awesome. I love this app
1648,"This is the app of my financial health dreams. It's easy to understand, breaks down what should be priority to pay off and the scenario festure is awesome. tells me what ive spent this month and what is left, and what can go towards savings or paying extra on credit card debt. I love it."
1649,"It's so easy to use and I feel like I really have a greater understanding of how and where I spend my money since using nerdwallet. I can easily see how much I actually have compared to my credit cards and other debt, and I can see how my savings and other accounts are doing. Great app and great company!"
1650,"Great way to track ALL your accounts (checking, savings, beneficiary IRAs, etc) in one place. Not a super detailed budget app, but good enough to help track expenses. Excellent for weekly updates to your credit score. Lots of suggested articles to read to help improve your financial situation."
1651,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. It's like a mix of credit karma/moneylion with budgeting and a full financial picture. Well done. 5/5***** UPDATE: This app got even better knowing that I'm able to connect even my venmo, cashapp, and prepaid card accounts. Beautifully done Nerd Wallet!"

1690,I really love this app.
1691,"To put plain and simple, after I open the app I couldn't put it down. I was in it for 4 hours before I looked up. The tools, tips, and financial advice is unlimited. I actually downloaded the app for advice on how to get rewards and cash back from my debit and bank cards. I got a lot more than what I bargined for. The app is literally a college level financial course, a budget guide, and a financial advisor balled in to an app."
1692,Very satisfactory
1693,Appreciate being able to monitor my cashflow and credit score in one place.
1694,"New at this, so far so good"

1721,"I like how it's all in one place, my smart phone."
1722,Pretty decent app. I prefer this one over many others? But my love uses a different one that he won't back away from as it helps with rebuilding in a very specific format
1723,I like this app its accurate üëå
1724,"UPDATE: They fixed it, and it works just fine right now. And the customer service/tech support rep was fantastic. ORIGINAL: Since the last update, the app just asks me to link to my accounts and then when I try to relink it tells me they're already linked and to try another account which it then tells me I've already linked to... and it's an infinite loop. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and so on. So, I'd say NerdWallet is a cool service, the app is terrible."
1725,Great app
1726,Love!
1727,I was gonna wait awhile and see how many stars it deserves but you just keep bugging me about rating it so there 5 stars is that what you wanted r u happy now r ur nipples all hard and pointy hmm?
1728,"Love it! Easy to use and actually extremely helpful, unlike many other similar apps. This one's different, 100% does what's promised if you apply the knowledge given and take time to click on provided links/resources. Also love the design and interface is just amazing as well. Don't give 5 stars much but this app and Self are the two 5 stars I highly recommend for getting finances and credit on track!"

1738,Quick account reporting. App does instruct you how to build and monitor your credit. Good app!
1739,NerdWallet actually gives me a sense of my finances and how to manage them. I appreciate the guides and tips as well! I find the app very useful and I would highly recommend it.
1740,Savant and nerd creating screds ü§óü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë

1745,Hay I have a add on my phone need wallet asking me if I want to make a fake bitcoin what is that about I'm a business woman not a theft like the government of Utah so don't play with me why would I want to make a fake coin when I have enough currency to make real ones. And open a bank. But Thanks and no thanks I'm minning as we text on my devices so really no thanks.
1746,Love it . Keeps track of my impulse buys and my investments ..... Which are also impulse buys üíØüî•
1747,I wouldike app more when I see some of my money on any of me debit cards
1748,Great app for personal financial management
1749,It's the best bet I couldn't have any better peace of mind and I know where my money is going my credit cards in good standing and I just keep up the good work too strong thank you
1750,Very helpful to me including that its been very hard for me too open my accounts its always one thing or another
1751,This app is secure. I use NerdWallet to find the best credit cards fir my current situation. THIS APP IS A MUST!
1752,Excellent budget app. Well worth the subscription to download from your bank. Quick and easy to plan and track spending.
1753,top of the line product. you won't find an easier budget app... and it's FREE!
1754,Very simple and easy to use. I really like how it tracks all spending. 5STARS!
1755,"I'm on BS3 now. It took me a while to figure out the phone app (desktop is Great!) but now its so easy to drag and drop from my bank (once they got the connection working) to the specific tracking categories. Life's much easier. The only downside is i have to push the save button several times (i.e., have to touch it exactly right) for it to take! Annoying."
1756,"I had absolutely no idea how much I was spending. After creating a budget through the app, I realized I could allocate money and still do the fun things I want to do and pay off debt at the same time while following Dave Ramsey's program.highly recommended."
1757,3/12/2021 I have been using this app for several years and I love it. Change phone from a Samsung Galaxy to a One Plus and it is giving me a message that it cannot connect to the server. I have no idea what is going on. 5/7/2021 Yes! Problem with the app fixed. Like a month ago I tried to use the app again and it worked! Have no idea what the problem was but I am able to use it again. Maybe it had something to do with an update. Whatever it was it doesn't matter it works. Great app. Thanks!
1758,Love this app. Shows me where my money is at all times. Would love to see a calendar added so you could see what's due in calendar form.. Maybe I'm old fashion. Great app!
1759,"Love this app. I've been able to consistently budget now that there is something easy to use that keeps me on track. Now instead of looking at how much money is in the bank, I look to see if there is room in the budget."
1760,"It's really good. I love it. One thing I would recommend is to have an undo button always up, because if I put something in the wrong category I'm forced to delete it and create one by hand."
1761,"Works well, great way to keep track of budget when out and about. Looks a little different then website, nevertheless has the same content."
1762,"Great app but one request - please make it so I can edit the starting balance for funds in upcoming months. Right now, I am unable to edit the starting balance of funds for, for example, next month. Not sure why I can't currently do this, but please allow users to do this as it would be helpful for planning. Thanks"
1763,This app is great. I can see exactly how much I have left in each category of my budget right on my home page. 5 stars!
1764,This app is a great tool to work on getting ahold of your finances. It is helping me stay on top of my spending and work on starting the debt snowball.
1765,*Update* I figured it out! Changed to five stars! I spent four hours personalizing my budget only to find most of it doesn't transfer over to the next month. Useless if I have to start from square one every month.
1766,"What a great app! I'm just learning how to budget well, I have a very basic budget. This app is super helpful."
1767,This app is fantastic. It allows me to keep my spending/budget in real-time. Love it
1768,Very helpful at managing spending on a disciplined budget!
1769,Absolutely great app. Makes budgeting a snap!
1770,Excellent and easy to use
1771,Makes it very easy to stay in top of our budget organization
1772,Easy to use and helps people who have denial of how much you really spend
1773,Best budgeting app I've found so far!
1774,"The automated transaction tracking when connected with your bank account is pretty sweet. All you need to do is assign the transactions to specific budget line items when they come in, but getting all the transactions was 80% of the struggle for me. So glad this solves that! And the more you use the app, it begins to suggest the appropriate line item. Hence, 95% of my day-to-day transaction tracking burden lifted :-)"
1775,"Been using the app for about 5 months now, 2 months using the premium service. I has completely changed my spending, saving and investing habits for the better. The premium service makes things so much easier by linking to your bank account. At first, i didnt exactly like the bank linkage cause it seemed like i wasnt participating in my finances as much but by the end of month 2 i am starting to appreciate it. Thank you all at Ramsey Solutions, big fan of all of you."
1776,"My expenses used to get away from me till I found this app. I found it nearly impossible to save money consistently. It seemed no matter what it did, I was always tight on money, waiting for my next paycheck. It's 100% true with Dave Ramsey says about if you don't tell your money where it should go, you'll wonder where it went. Now I actually ENJOY budgeting. I literally get excited to categorize my expenses and see if I'm on track. This app will help you become an adult with your finances"
1777,I love this app! I've been using the free version of this app to manage our family budget since July 2020. I know where literally every penny of our income goes. I love being able to set a budget but then easily adjust it as life happens so that we stil live within our means. Some people might find it tedious to type in each transaction (if you do I guess you could get the paid-for version) but I enjoy it because it makes me more mindful of our spending and helps keep us on track.
1778,"UPDATE: A HUGE thank you to the Ramsey Solution Team. Their tech, Bobby, emailed daily to resolve the issue. I appreciate the updates, questions and effort. Great customer service! The app is working properly and all of the information has transferred to my phone. The program has helped me eliminate debt in less than a month. Looking forward to eliminating more. I like the program but there's a major issue. The app is not functioning properly. I created an account online. Downloaded the app. The information will not transfer. My accounts, categories, debt...nothing!"
1779,"I have premium and it's well worth it! I love that my bank is connected and that transactions are loaded, ready for me to organize. The staff is super helpful and budgeting is fast and easy. Each month preloads the last month for easy transition from month to month. Thanks to Ramsey Solutions!"
1780,This app has helped me tremendously. I use it everyday. It's my righthand. I only use the free version and it still is amazing. If you truly was to budget and start taking control of you finances this is the only app out there that you need. It's very simple to use and easy to follow. It does all the math for you. Give it a try. I promise you will enjoy it.
1781,"Have been using Every Dollar for years and it has been a crucial tool in helping us keep our budget on track. We have been paying down debt like crazy! It is so easy to use and having it linked with our bank account (for plus members) ensures that we never miss a transaction. It also forces us to plan out our expenses each month and agree on how much money to spend on certain things. Without this app, there is no way we would be as far along on our financial peace journey as we are."
1782,This is a super easy app to use for budgeting. The interface just makes so much sense and it's so easy to use. I like mint because it brings in your accounts transactions for free but there's a lot of ads and things like that. This app is very straightforward.
1783,"Great app by itself really helps you prioritize your budget without using pen and paper, but when you pay for the plus version it saves you the time of individually adding everything to your budget. Just link your bank account and move your transactions to where they go on ur budget and voila your done and can get back to your day"
1784,"Very easy to use and see where your budget bleeds money. Update: cannot delete emergency fund that I accidentally made a fund. Throwing off my whole budget. Please fix this. Still a great app, and it was my mistake, but need to have the ability to correct it."
1785,"Very easy to use. Good support experience. Support was able to provide what I needed, above their in-app features. I wanted the previous month's transactions pulled in and they made it happen."
1786,"I wish I could hold/drag and reorganize labels and categories. I love being able to sort my purchases with bubbles. I love the widget! Truebill makes me go into the transaction and manually switch the category, even for transactions that have recurred for months."
1787,"The best, most simple budgeting app out there. Started with the free version and moved up to the subscription. Budget balances at our fingertips. It even tracks your sinking fund by category. Couldn't be happier."
1788,"Was working great but since the new update alot of my totals won't show. My income slots for the month disappeared making it hard to track anything. I tried uninstalling the app and downloading again, same results. Please fix this."
1789,The simplicity of this app is what has helped me to stay on top of it whereas I have gotten too bogged down in the details with other tools and sites like mint
1790,"Excellent and life changing for us. VERY easy to use. Has a few glitches, but still learning some of the advanced areas of the program."
1791,Really easy to set up and organize. Access quickly and easily track every penny spent. Great app!!
1792,Love this app! It keeps me on track!
1793,So far it's allowing me to see where my finances are going. The menu is easy to manage and there's some cool graphs if you're a visual person
1794,Great way to keep a check on your spending.
1795,"This is a great, simple to use budget app! Upgrading to the paid version is more than worth it!"
1796,"The drag and drop is super convenient! I love this app, it is so helpful to keeping me organized financially."
1797,Love this app! It's so easy to use and I love how it automatically pulls in all activity from my checking account!
1798,Zero based budgets are extremely helpful in making you intentional with your money instead of floundering aimlessly. This is one of those budget apps.
1799,Easy to use. Great for budgeting and staying on track. Still learning all the features
1800,This app is the best budgeting app bar none. I have refered most my friends and family to it as well.
1801,"Super helpful. Still learning how to use some parts of it, but a very good app"
1802,"Wow. Usually a Quicken guy, but with bank integration staying on track couldn't be easier."
1803,Easiest budget tool i have ever used. Fun to see where every dollar goes!
1804,I use this app everyday to keep our money on track. It's incredibly easy!
1805,Easy to use and keep track of your expenses and money goals.
1806,"My favorite budgeting app, super easy and fun to use!"
1807,My husband and I love this app!
1808,Very user friendly! Keeps my husband and I on track daily.
1809,Great budgeting tool. Simple and easy to use.
1810,This app makes doing my budget a breeze. It also let's me see where I am at on my spending.
1811,"Amazing app, links to your bank account for easier budgeting!"
1812,Great app for budgeting.. it's the key to building wealth.
1813,This app has really help me curb my spending and pay down my debt.
1814,Really easy to work with and figure out.
1815,Easy to use. Has been a huge help in getting my finances under control
1816,Love this app. Finally have been budgeting..almost three months now!
1817,Dead simple budgeting! üòéüëå
1818,"If one is trying to get out of debt, this is the app to use. I use it with my family and it helps us grow financially."
1819,Great budget tool. Dave Ramsey is awesome!
1820,Great app for tracking expenses.
1821,This has been super helpful for keeping my budgeting on track.
1822,Very easy to use and to track your progress.
1823,Great app that works well.
1824,Dave Ramsey changed my life. Use this app and take his FPU course if you finally want to be free from debt and finances holding you back.
1825,Been using it for 4 years and absolutely love it. Highly recommend.
1826,"Fantastic so far, my first ten days are going well."
1827,"Outstanding app! Really helped me managing my money while I was living paycheck to paycheck. There's a ""pro-version"" you can get that directly links to your bank account to track every dollar you spend, but I preferred to save the money and manually input my expenses. This is a great place to start saving for your future or getting yourself out of debt. If you haven't heard of Dave Ramsey (the developer of this app), I'd highly recommend you look up his show on YouTube!"
1828,"it works well. I like the number of budget categories you can have. I had an issue, their customer support reached out quickly. The issue is now resolved."
1829,Amazing app! I know where my money is going now.
1830,"LOVE üòç EveryDollar! As a Ramsey+ Member, the new feature that syncs our debt with The Baby Steps App can be frustrating though. I also use EveryDollar Plus, the premium or paid version of the app (costs $9.99 plus applicable taxes). Being able to sync my accounts allows me to better track our spending which has helped us pay of thousands in debt within the last year!"
1831,Best Budgeting App! I've used several budgeting apps and the pro is so worth it. All you do is just drag and drop the charges from your bank onto your categories and it's more accurate than just guessing on a written budget. It really is keeping me more accurate down to every dollar I have to my name each month!
1832,I thought I wouldnt like a budget app as I always thought I did a pretty decent job. I love this app with its ease of use and features. It really ahows you where your $ is going. Worth every penny.
1833,"I enyou the app and the desktop version. I'm a paid subscriber, so I get my bank transactions automatically in this app so I can put them in categories. For the budgeting at the beginning of the month, I prefer to use the desktop, since it's easier to change the amount I'm budgeting in a category."
1834,"I love this app! It has helped our family keep track of our budget, and we are quickly learning how great it is to know where your money is going, instead of wondering where your money went at the end of each month!"
1835,"Smooth easy to use,good support team!"
1836,Made my life a whole lot easier and freed up so much time.
1837,"Amazing app, once you get the the hang of the functionality its a piece of cake. Most of the complaints I've seen are issues that can easily be fixed; for instance duplicate transactions can be deleted, there is a trashcan icon that gives you the option to delete transactions. We have done this when we transfer money because the app tracks this. If you are serious about budgeting get this app. Me and my wife have been using it for over two months and have had no issues. It makes budgeting fun!"
1838,"Very useful, easy to use! I dont have the premium version that directly sets up your bank account to the app, so I do have to manually enter every purchase or income; however, that makes me more aware of where my money is going. It reminds you to make a new budget for the upcoming month and also tells you how far off you are from having an Every Dollar Budget! I give it 5 stars because I dont go a single month without using it anymore"
1839,"App is so easy to use and worth the $$$ to upgrade. I keep track of literally every dollar I spend. I used it to track my spending for 2 months before I set a budget for myself. Ummm...I have definitely been living excessively and above my means. I needed this so much. The upgrade allows you to link your accounts so all you have to do is slide the transaction to the budgeted area! If you are disciplined and can take the time to input transactions as you spend, then you probably dont need the upgrade. Every friend I have shared this with uses it now. Love, love, love....!!!"
1840,Pros: Easy to use. Nice layout. Simple concept. Makes reconciling purchases to your budget a breeze (when it works) Cons: It doesn't work reliably. This is the second time I have given everydollar a try. The first time everydollar had errors that couldn't be resolved trying to connect an account I had a debt with. It is a shame because I like the app and it wasn't cheap. please let people download their bank transactions and import them. ive moved on to another app now. its a blessing i guess
1841,"I love the layout of this app! It's so easy to use and yet can be as detailed and broken down as you want it to be. The many different colors help keep everything more organized and easy to look at! I feel like budgeting w/this app is more like a game than a chore. We started w/the free version and quickly upgraded to the yearly membership. Having it link your spending and all you have to do is drag and drop!?! There is nothing better! It allows us to do a ""cash-type budget"" still using our cards"
1842,"Exceptional!! I was torn between downloading this one or keeping the Home Budget app. which I have used for years. I used Dave Ramsey's program years ago, but their app. at that time was awful. At that time, it may as well have been for a 3 yr. old. NOT SO NOW! I was pleasantly surprised, and have moved all of my information to EveryDollar. I can't wait to start following Dave's advice again."
1843,"One of the Best Budgeting Apps! There are 2 versions of the app. The free version or the paid Subscription...they both work well. I prefer to the free version, since I log everything manually. The paid version will automatically download your transactions from the bank. My wife has the app on her phone, & w/ the same log in, she can see where we sit on the budget. One step closer to becoming an everyday Millionaire!"
1844,"I recomend getting the version that syncs to your bank account. Wish the transcactions would pop up sooner, but don't know if that can really be helped."
1845,Great for creating a budget and keeping it. Essential for people who struggle with money and a relief for those who already do! Thank you for designing.
1846,"So easy to use! It has helped us reduce our spending and pay more attention to which categories we're spending too much in. First time as adults we've had a financial plan and it seems too easy to be true! We're able to now save for a house, we already paid off all debt and have a fully funded emergency fund. Not possible without this app and Dave!"
1847,I absolutely LOVE this app! My only issue is I get paid bi-weekly. I need a 2 week budget option instead of monthly. I've paid 2 bills late so far because I thought they were due the next check. I've started just completely resetting my budget every 2 weeks but then I have to build it from the ground up instead of being able to use the last month's budget.
1848,"Love this app. Love the DR course, but I personally find it useless to pay the upgraded paid version because I don't understand how people can stick to a budget when everything it auto-added for them. HOWEVER. Apparently it's not available in Canada, so while I've been sharing our great testimony with this app, none of them can download it anymore. Mine is still functioning normally, but I'm worried it's going to suddenly stop working. Fix this please!!"
1849,"Amazing. I will never use another budget app again, and I've ""used them all."" The very simple ""drag and drop"" design makes keeping track of transactions from your bank account truly (and I do mean TRULY), unprecedentedly, easy. I actually look forward to keeping track of our budget and expenses now. Thank you EveryDollar, you have a Plus member out of me!"
1850,"This app has really helped me control my spending over the last couple months. My wife and I have been able to follow a financial ""diet"" and clear away some debt. I would love it if there was a monthly summary report option where I could compare my budget vs spending easier on one page, perhaps a monthly comparison report too. Regardless, five stars, thank you everydollar team! Great job!"
1851,"I LOVE this app!! My husband and I are currently working on baby step 2, and this app makes it SO EASY to track my budget and see what I have, what I've spent, and what I have left in one place. It is helpful especially since we have irregular income. I do pay for the plus, but I have found it is worth it as I can manually enter my transactions to keep a running total, and then easily delete the double. I am excited to see our financial change in the next couple years!"
1852,"We love this app, and the whole concept behind it. We tried using Every Dollar a couple years ago and it was very difficult and clunky so we stopped. That's not the case anymore, they've worked out the bugs! We've been doing DR budgeting for years but this app makes it much easier to stay in the same page with the budget, especially woke paying down student debt."
1853,Excellent budget app. Well worth the subscription to download from your bank. Quick and easy to plan and track spending.
1854,top of the line product. you won't find an easier budget app... and it's FREE!
1855,Good app
1856,Excellent and easy to use
1857,Love this app! It keeps me on track!
1858,Very simple and easy to use. I really like how it tracks all spending. 5STARS!
1859,Best tool out there
1860,This app has really help me curb my spending and pay down my debt.
1861,Wooooooooo
1862,Absolutely great app. Makes budgeting a snap!
1863,Great app that works well.
1864,"I had absolutely no idea how much I was spending. After creating a budget through the app, I realized I could allocate money and still do the fun things I want to do and pay off debt at the same time while following Dave Ramsey's program.highly recommended."
1865,Excellent budgeting app
1866,Makes it very easy to stay in top of our budget organization

1874,"Love this app. I've been able to consistently budget now that there is something easy to use that keeps me on track. Now instead of looking at how much money is in the bank, I look to see if there is room in the budget."
1875,I. Love. This. App.
1876,Very helpful.
1877,Almost debt free in a year! neeeeevee√®rrrr going back!
1878,Love this app. Shows me where my money is at all times. Would love to see a calendar added so you could see what's due in calendar form.. Maybe I'm old fashion. Great app!

1880,Dead simple budgeting! üòéüëå
1881,This app is great. I can see exactly how much I have left in each category of my budget right on my home page. 5 stars!
1882,"What a great app! I'm just learning how to budget well, I have a very basic budget. This app is super helpful."
1883,This app is fantastic. It allows me to keep my spending/budget in real-time. Love it
1884,Yes yes
1885,"Didn't work for me, but great app anyway"
1886,"I'm on BS3 now. It took me a while to figure out the phone app (desktop is Great!) but now its so easy to drag and drop from my bank (once they got the connection working) to the specific tracking categories. Life's much easier. The only downside is i have to push the save button several times (i.e., have to touch it exactly right) for it to take! Annoying."
1887,Great
1888,"Works well, great way to keep track of budget when out and about. Looks a little different then website, nevertheless has the same content."
1889,*Update* I figured it out! Changed to five stars! I spent four hours personalizing my budget only to find most of it doesn't transfer over to the next month. Useless if I have to start from square one every month.
1890,Easy and Fun too use!
1891,"It's really good. I love it. One thing I would recommend is to have an undo button always up, because if I put something in the wrong category I'm forced to delete it and create one by hand."
1892,3/12/2021 I have been using this app for several years and I love it. Change phone from a Samsung Galaxy to a One Plus and it is giving me a message that it cannot connect to the server. I have no idea what is going on. 5/7/2021 Yes! Problem with the app fixed. Like a month ago I tried to use the app again and it worked! Have no idea what the problem was but I am able to use it again. Maybe it had something to do with an update. Whatever it was it doesn't matter it works. Great app. Thanks!
1893,"it works well. I like the number of budget categories you can have. I had an issue, their customer support reached out quickly. The issue is now resolved."
1894,I've used this app for 4 years now. It is a great way to budget and track expenses. Big fan of the Ramsey method. The only thing I don't like about the app vs the website is the app doesn't tell you the account the expense came from so If you pay for items using multiple accounts/ cards you may file them in the wrong month. But I just found out There is way to open the item and unchecked the filing option which will allow you refile it correctly...easy once you know how to do it.
1895,This app is a great tool to work on getting ahold of your finances. It is helping me stay on top of my spending and work on starting the debt snowball.
1896,Great
1897,Pauline stewart parker PCH prize Patrol PCH com
1898,Nice apps
1899,"Great app but one request - please make it so I can edit the starting balance for funds in upcoming months. Right now, I am unable to edit the starting balance of funds for, for example, next month. Not sure why I can't currently do this, but please allow users to do this as it would be helpful for planning. Thanks"
1900,Easy to use and helps people who have denial of how much you really spend
1901,This is a good app to help set a budget. Anything from Dave Ramsey is a good thing.
1902,Best budgeting app I've found so far!
1903,Good
1904,Looking forward to making ends meet while I attend school
1905,Awesome! Really helps
1906,Simplest budget app every! Syncs seamlessly with all of my banking accounts
1907,Very user friendly! Keeps my husband and I on track daily.
1908,Great easy to use
1909,EveryDollarBu
1910,Easy! Especially if you have the plus membership!
1911,"Have been using Every Dollar for years and it has been a crucial tool in helping us keep our budget on track. We have been paying down debt like crazy! It is so easy to use and having it linked with our bank account (for plus members) ensures that we never miss a transaction. It also forces us to plan out our expenses each month and agree on how much money to spend on certain things. Without this app, there is no way we would be as far along on our financial peace journey as we are."
1912,Easy to use
1913,Great budgeting tool. Simple and easy to use.
1914,"The best, most simple budgeting app out there. Started with the free version and moved up to the subscription. Budget balances at our fingertips. It even tracks your sinking fund by category. Couldn't be happier."
1915,"Excellent and life changing for us. VERY easy to use. Has a few glitches, but still learning some of the advanced areas of the program."
1916,"I have premium and it's well worth it! I love that my bank is connected and that transactions are loaded, ready for me to organize. The staff is super helpful and budgeting is fast and easy. Each month preloads the last month for easy transition from month to month. Thanks to Ramsey Solutions!"
1917,So far it's allowing me to see where my finances are going. The menu is easy to manage and there's some cool graphs if you're a visual person
1918,I have to use this
1919,"Very easy to use and see where your budget bleeds money. Update: cannot delete emergency fund that I accidentally made a fund. Throwing off my whole budget. Please fix this. Still a great app, and it was my mistake, but need to have the ability to correct it."
1920,I love this app! I've been using the free version of this app to manage our family budget since July 2020. I know where literally every penny of our income goes. I love being able to set a budget but then easily adjust it as life happens so that we stil live within our means. Some people might find it tedious to type in each transaction (if you do I guess you could get the paid-for version) but I enjoy it because it makes me more mindful of our spending and helps keep us on track.
1921,Great budget tool. Dave Ramsey is awesome!
1922,Awesome tool for running a tight budget!
1923,I use this app everyday to keep our money on track. It's incredibly easy!
1924,This app is the best budgeting app bar none. I have refered most my friends and family to it as well.
1925,Love it
1926,I finally know where my money goes!
1927,Great app for tracking expenses.
1928,Helps me budget my life expensive!
1929,Recommendation for everyone theshantelheartshowblogradio EnisedDiplomacyAlliance podcast
1930,"If one is trying to get out of debt, this is the app to use. I use it with my family and it helps us grow financially."
1931,Awesome
1932,Your programs and services gives me hope and vision.
1933,Easy to use and keep track of your expenses and money goals.
1934,Great app for budgeting.. it's the key to building wealth.
1935,Love this app. Finally have been budgeting..almost three months now!
1936,"Very easy to use. Good support experience. Support was able to provide what I needed, above their in-app features. I wanted the previous month's transactions pulled in and they made it happen."
1937,Love it
1938,Amazing app! I know where my money is going now.
1939,"Smooth easy to use,good support team!"
1940,Easy to use. Great for budgeting and staying on track. Still learning all the features
1941,"Wow. Usually a Quicken guy, but with bank integration staying on track couldn't be easier."
1942,Zero based budgets are extremely helpful in making you intentional with your money instead of floundering aimlessly. This is one of those budget apps.
1943,"I love this app! It has helped our family keep track of our budget, and we are quickly learning how great it is to know where your money is going, instead of wondering where your money went at the end of each month!"
1944,"Been using the app for about 5 months now, 2 months using the premium service. I has completely changed my spending, saving and investing habits for the better. The premium service makes things so much easier by linking to your bank account. At first, i didnt exactly like the bank linkage cause it seemed like i wasnt participating in my finances as much but by the end of month 2 i am starting to appreciate it. Thank you all at Ramsey Solutions, big fan of all of you."
1945,"I wish I could hold/drag and reorganize labels and categories. I love being able to sort my purchases with bubbles. I love the widget! Truebill makes me go into the transaction and manually switch the category, even for transactions that have recurred for months."
1946,Good!!!!
1947,Easy to use. Has been a huge help in getting my finances under control
1948,Easy to use budgeting tool. Can also be used in conjunction with Financial Peace tools to get out of debt and stay out of debt.
1949,"The automated transaction tracking when connected with your bank account is pretty sweet. All you need to do is assign the transactions to specific budget line items when they come in, but getting all the transactions was 80% of the struggle for me. So glad this solves that! And the more you use the app, it begins to suggest the appropriate line item. Hence, 95% of my day-to-day transaction tracking burden lifted :-)"
1950,Great tool!!
1951,This has been super helpful for keeping my budgeting on track.
1952,"Although I have experienced some issues after initial release of v.5, for several months now the app works okay for me. On the contrast, I had sync issues with v.4. Recent update 5.0.28 seems to make the app faster as well. It takes up to 5 seconds to load for me, which I think is, well, normal for an app. Maybe it all depends on the phone being used, but I have not experienced most of issues that others have for a long time."
1953,"Great budgeting app, helped me and my wife to budget together. Thank you spendee!"
1954,"The app works with an acceptable speed again, after changing my phone to a newer model"
1955,"Recent update to v5 was a struggle, but looks like Spendee team is managing it already. Submitting a transaction was a pain after the update, but it got fixed! Good job. It would be a pity to migrate to another budgeting app and now I don't have to."
1956,The app is great but I can't connect bank. I wrote email to the support and I am still waiting for help. For manual tracking perfectly ok.
1957,"I stayed away from the app as they didn't support my bank. They added a bunch more banks recently including mine, so I can finally use it. Seems good so far."
1958,"I stopped using the app but decided to try again. The problems they had are gone, so I'll stay now! New version is nicer, I am missing the touch id, but it will be hopefully bakc soon."
1959,"It has all the features I need, including making budgets. Free version is pretty good too. Do recommend"
1960,"App is good.. but lately they have removed the average daily expense from the dashboard, it was really helpful for an insight."
1961,It's convenient and accurate! What else do you need? : ) It makes keeping accounts so much easier and on the go
1962,"The app was SUPER slow recently! Don't know what they did, but it's so much faster now. I can finally use it normally."
1963,Great app! This is where i can update expenses using different device much more easier and up to date
1964,"Very good! This app is easy to use, beautiful icons and easy access."
1965,"Very useful, thanks for the development team prompt response for the recurrence function issue."
1966,Absolutely awesome it is value packed and is great for stats and easy to use very customizable
1967,Great. There are many options to customize for your needs. I like the way they have designed.
1968,I updated to the latest version and it seems like most of the problems that have been mentioned have been resolved. Good job!
1969,Very useful and feature rich app that is constantly updated. Many thanks to the developer.
1970,I have been using this app for a couple of years now. Works smooth and gives me what i need.
1971,"Good way to track our expenses there is a bug in the latest update. When I try to change the date while updating the expenses, the dates are not shown it's fully blank."
1972,"Well, I must say, it's working as expected now after the latest update. Thanks guys!!"
1973,"I loved Spendee on my IPhone, it worked wonderfully and I think there is no other money app like this one to compare. But on Android (Xiaomi) the app is full of bugs and less efficient and with worse work flow than the one on IOS. I must say their customer service is great and they helped me with everything, but I am loosing my patience with all the bugs that are appearing. I would quit using it if there was any app to change."
1974,"I've been using this app for some time and I love the simplicity which helps you track your finances. The app overall works fine even with the new update, a bit slow sometimes after this update but overall works perfect for me."
1975,"Absolutely amazing. I've tried many finance tracking apps over the years, and finally found the one. It integrates with the bank, so you can import every transacion in every account (current, credit, etc) in your bank, going back as long as the bank allows (10 months in my case). It allows you to create manual accounts, to represent other sources that can't be tracked. It understands transfers: money that you move from one account to another (paying the credit card, for example). And much more!"
1976,"I have a lifetime subscription. Have to get more used to the new interface, but I like it pretty much. I like the detailed view of the cash flow and the graphs and I love the dark mode. It is a bit slower but it's still the best app for personal finance tracking. Keep it up guys! :)"
1977,"Using Spendee since 2015, and I love it! Because of the App's UI and functionality, as well as excellent customer service. Although it is slow now, I will wait for you to optimize it~"
1978,I am also thinking about trying other apps coz last update UI wise was ok but it made app really really slow. Cant do anything without 2-3 seconds lag and reloading Edit: App is fixed now and seems fast again. Rating 5 stars
1979,"It was way easier & faster in the previous version. Now the +, -, x, √∑ doesn't even work while entrying a transaction"
1980,I like new version features and outloking. But application speed should be better. Older application was working faster
1981,We use Spendee to pay off our student debt with my husband. Hope we get there soon. Thank you Spendee.
1982,Changing my review as you changed your app's overall user experience. The latest update REALLY WORKS for me! üòä
1983,"Great app, easy to use and flexible"
1984,Updated on 15 Jan 2021 Thanks for the follow up respond from development team. It works now. üëç --------------------------------------------- It was very handy when I could use both app and webpage. But now the webpage has shown temporarily read mode only since last Oct although it said it will be back to normal after mid November. Hope this issue can be fixed soon.
1985,"Just deleted old bad review which I left before when spendee had performance issue. I loved spendee but I never left review before, but I left it as soon as I faced issue. Now I realized that it's not a good manner as I used Spendee for many years without complaint. Although I am not using spendee for now bcz It's not good fit for me since the major update released, I believe Spendee is still the best for many ppl. Cheers!"
1986,It work is efficient! I'm using it to manage my store's cash flow. I wish I have an option to add another one to manage my salary.
1987,"Great app! Very helpful to track our expenses and budgets. The UX and UI is much better than other similar app. Simple yet powerful. Also great response from the support team whenever issue or problem occurs, and this is coming from my personal experience. Been using this app for almost two years now, and I still haven't the reason not to.. Keep up the good work! üëç"
1988,"Great for budgeting, even at the free tier. I have just a couple complaints: - There's no way to create your own categories, so you have to shoehorn some things into a category that doesn't really fit. This is alleviated by the notes (hashtags), but it would have been nice to have them actually separated. - Internally, it keeps track of transactions in USD, even when all transactions are in a foreign currency. This accumulates tiny errors, but usually it's not a big deal."
1989,"I have the free version of the app, and I like it for the most part, especially the simplicity, and the ability to attach photos to items (for receipts). It does not connect to my particular bank, but I am okay with that. Edit: Originally I had what turned out to be a sync issue which caused very high background data use. But I uninstalled and reinstalled (with the latest update as well) and it appears to be fixed now. Thank you, Spendee support, for your help."
1990,I've been using this app for about three years and continue to be pleased with it. So much so that I actually paid for it after using the free version for most of that time. Customer service has been helpful and quick and the customizeable categories are super handy for running a small business and tracking categories for tax purposes. Becaude most transactions are in cash I hand enter all my data except for a few reoccurring expenses and it's pretty simple. User interface is mostly intuitive.
1991,"I love the app, but after the last update there is an issue with the could sync on android 9.0 when you try to sync your transaction an erroe message on the bottom of the screen appreas Something went wrong try again later. UPDATE: I was asked to contact the developer and after few days the issue have been resolved. The support team was great to keep you updated on the status of your email. 5 stars well deserved."
1992,"There is a constant crash! App is continiously crashing. Edit: I made it couple of times. The budget part causes crashing. New upgrade does not fix problem. Sorry but after a long time, i start to think about changing my tracker app. Edit2: The problem is finally fixed. I turned back to the app. Actually, I think I am the most loyal costumer of you. I periodically check whether the app becomes functional. Thank to me üòÖ"
1993,"Absolutely the best app for tracking costs and budgets. It's also visually most appealing among all of them, really clean and modern design. I am really glad I am lifetime premium user. Free version isn't limiting users in any way. That's why I started using it in first place. Recommending it fully to all my friends."
1994,"I have been using this app for over two years now. It replaced my Mint account. I like to have several wallets to track all my money, and this does the trick. You can also set budgets. I don't like to sync my accounts because I like to manually input and categorize them in my own way, but that option is also available. Wonderfully simple, and I can do it all mobile."
1995,"Absolutely the best on the market. New features such as split transaction would be good as well as setting income budgets and recurring transactions, but this product makes life much easier. But firstly I want to tell I tried and tested virtually every similar application available through the Android store. Apart from a couple that had elements I liked they didn't have the ease at which this product had hands down. I will give a larger review to this soon."
1996,"Best app in market to manage it money üí∞ Easy & comfortable UI. Have one suggestion, if the user is able to select two tags that will be amazing. Eg: I can select food tag & travel tag, which means I spent 400 on food and my total travel spend will also be added. And that can be displayed in pie chart as second layer. Hell lot of effort required. But it's a great update."
1997,"I absolutely love this app! I've been using it for every transaction for the last year and a half. It has most certainly allowed me to keep track of my money much more accurately. Now when I wonder, ""Damn where has my money all gone?!"" I just open the app and it tells me straight away! Which isn't necessarily a good thing üòÖ couldn't recommend this app enough!"
1998,"Great app. I'd like the option to change the order of the categories and to pre-populate when I start typing. Otherwise the app hasn't let me down yet. Edit: thanks to the developers for responding so quickly. I was able to re-order my categories, and upon closer inspection the app already pre-populates previously used hashtags. Thanks for making a great app!"
1999,"I don't think I've ever reviewed any app. This deserves it. Been a user for 3 months going into 4, and I can't imagine being without it. It has been so helpful and informative in pushing me towards my financial goals. I recommend it to EVERYONE. Ease of use, interface, charts, graphs, the whole package! I've tried *every* other budget app and none of them are this good. THANK YOU!!!!!"
2000,"Just gone thru a process with Spendee team fixing a strange problem with the app. Their customer service team were amazing and they really wanted to help (thanks Eliska! And the dev ninja behind the scene too!). What a relief that I could finally continue to use this app, as I couldn't actually find a better one than Spendee after a few years hunt for a high quality financial app. Keep it up üëç"
2001,"Spendee is far and away the best budget app for our purposes. It syncs quickly to the cloud so my wife and I can share transactions. It's easy to use. It allows creating ""wallets"" for when you just want to track some transactions without scraping data from your bank account. This is extremely useful for us, because credit card transactions often take days or even weeks to be registered as complete. This way we can get those points and make sure we don't spend too much!"
2002,"Great app that I've been using every day for years without issues, but the new update has rendered it unusable, as it won't open and just continually crashes. I hope the developers can fix it soon. Update: after reaching out to the developers, a new update arrived 24 hours later and the app works again! Great customer service!"
2003,"After update new version I encounter new bug. Type bug which cursor alway is at begin of text box. I can't use shift for capital letter. I can't edit any text, it annoy me. And it delay when choose category. Also bug when you press back button after you press create transaction. Sometime I can't choose category. Finally it use 50% of my cpu. so, please fix it. After update to lastest version I can use app normally. Thank you for fast respond."
2004,"I absolutely love this app - it's pretty straight forward to use and, while it does come with some nice customization options, they're not necessary at ALL. I really appreciate it's simplicity, which allows me to properly keep track of things quickly submitting an expense."
2005,Really like the ability to automatically update from accounts (premium feature). Had trouble initially importing historical data but when requested help got prompt and informative response - made it straightforward. So good to collect all data in one location and see overall financial position at a glance or dig into specific details at the touch of a button or two.
2006,"I have tried more budgeting apps but I like this one for its simplicity, but still powerfull with its hastag and place functionality and filtering via web app. What I would appreciate are time charts for budgets as they are in the overview. One bug I found is the when adding a new transaction, 10*0.5 does not work but 0.5*10 does."
2007,"Good financial and budgeting apps with a reasonable price. Highly recommended. However, the user interface between ios and android is difference, while I found that I have a better experience on ios user interface. Additionally, I have a recommendation wish to suggest to the developer, the user experience will be enhance if there are more variation and option on icon. Subscribed to your plan to support your team effort. Keep it up and wish to see more enhancement on this apps."
2008,Really useful for my wife and I to share and track our household expenses. Takes a bit of setup. We track our expenses on a daily basis. Is quick and accurate. We paid for the one time payment for full access. If there is one improvement = Only thing I would say that initially when I used this app it is not automatically intuitive at times on how accounts vs budgets vs wallets. What are their links or how to make them link.
2009,"Better than the other similar apps. I use this because it makes my life better by telling me exactly where the funk my money goes, without needing me to tell it first. It connects to my banks and credit card companies and sorts and labels each item automatically. I know now where to make changes in my behaviour. Recommended to all spendaholics. It's really reasonably priced too!"
2010,"I have tried many apps and solutions to help me manage and control my finances. But none have managed to reach my needs and expectations as Spendee. Spendee is easy to use, extremely helpful and informative and it just works. With it's graphs, scheduled transactions and much more I am able to better control my finances. I don't usually go for paid subscriptions, but Spendee is definitely worth it. Also the support is great. Responsive and helpful!"
2011,"Amazing app. Friendly and easy to manage and digest. One problem is that the rate showing on the landing page is the rate after the conversion not the actual rate on amount in the preferred currency, so it was quite confusing. Is there any way or function that can fix this? Edit: Problem solved! Support Team provides such quick response."
2012,"The application helped me to clarify, and classify my expenses. Easy to use and will show you really what you are spending which helped me to plan how to spend wisely, and I found out that I didn't spend so much money on entertiment, which I need to take it into consideration while planning for the next month. you will enjoy the app if you love to plan and to structure things and it will support you with that. üòä"
2013,"Since you guys have been so responsive on the page. I really like the app, keep up the good work! Transfers feature really helped with reconciling income and expenses. Feature request: it'll be even better if I could split up expenses into parts for assigning transfers. This is useful as users sometimes pay for friends' purchases on card and settle up after. Entire business models have been built on this problem, so I'm sure it'll be an impactful feature to prioritise!"
2014,"July 2019 Update #2. The login issues experienced earlies this week have been resolved and Tech support was very responsive. 5 stars! July 2019 Update - after switching to the Pixel XL 3 I can't sign into Spendee. Tech support is looking into a fix (I will restore 5 star rating when fixed), until then then I cant advocate for it. We have been using Spendee for about 4 months now and are very happy with our paid (plus) version. I wish we could sort budgets (by end date for example)."
2015,"The best app to help tracking your spending so far. It's easy and fun to use. The dashboard provides good analysis and attractive graphic. Such pleasant experience makes you feel that you want to record everything as you want to get the results right. This app, even the free version is amazing!"
2016,"This app helped me take far better control of my finances by understanding where I was wasting large amounts of money, showing me each category of what I was spending money on was very insightful and helped me understand where I was going wrong. I was able to turn my finances around and save monthly significantly more than before I was using this app. Seeing how much money I wasted on things such as fast food and nights out also helped me to be more healthy and responsible overall."
2017,I have been trying budget and expense apps for a long time and finally settle on Spendee. The app shows me the insight of what I have been spending the most. It also helps me saving by creating budgets on things where I actually shouldn't spend too much. The pictures function assists me to keep track on the stores' receipts where I can compare and decide which stores that sell things cheaper than the others.
2018,"Perfect app for tracking your expenses. i do everything manually which i prefer. The app is designed wonderfully, the charts and graphs are fantastic, and everything is just made and organized perfectly. My only complaint is that I wish there was more icon options. Other than that, perfect app! Thank you guys!"
2019,"The only app I've been able to use for a very long time without getting bored of it. I've used almost all: gnucash, wallet, wally, toshl, monefy, money manager ex, every dollar, moneywiz, etc.. Spendee may not have as many features as some of these but the fact it's so easy to add expenses makes it easier to stick to it, long term. The overview it gives you of your spending is also great: by category, average expense, most active day, timeline, pie chart, etc."
2020,"I've been using Spendee for five years now and I like that the team continues to improve the app. Even though the last major update had problems at the very beginning, I now already see changes going in a good way. And I like the update overall! Being a developer myself, I can understand the struggles the team can have at the moment, so I'm waiting with patience and I still think Spendee is the best expense tracker out there."
2021,"Have only ever used this app to manage my finances. It has been such a great experience. Been using Spendee for quite a while now. Can't think of any reason to not use this app. I have a few suggestions one that make your Export and Import functionality more robust and also it doesn't properly track transfers between wallets in the backups. Secondly make a option to lock & unlock past transactions, to be sure that when locked, they are immutable to accidental change. Also trial should be 1 mon."
2022,I love this app. I can see where our money goes so easily.Great looking app too. There was a bit of a glitch when they first set it up but they were so helpful and got it back on track as quick as they could. Brilliant customer service. This app is the best of it's kind!!
2023,"I love Spendee, been using it for years. I wish the budget function can include Income categories to offset though - I use the app to track my credit spendings so I always key the transaction amount but sometimes I pay for others and get cash in return so in this scenario it would seem like I spent a lot and burst my budget even though I didn't. But all in all I love it! The new version confuses me but I found my wallet in dashboard which looks exactly like the past so I guess it's acceptable."
2024,"Hello. The app is very useful, thank you. I would like to see a few more functions: a graphics with the dynamics of spendings by category (in the selected period), a spending graphics for the whole month, the ability to make an annual budget. Thank you"
2025,This is a great tool for managing my expenses. User-friendly and not all over the place. One thing that I don't like is I'm a Plus user but the app keeps on bugging me about the Premium plan. I hope that there's an option to opt out of that banner. I'm all good with my current plan. Thank you!
2026,"Pros: Good money manager. Simple UI for a lot of features. Cons: Cant find option to turn off decimal digits, and turn off some unwanted notifications (the Notifications category in Options doesn't help). So for now, I will stick to my old manager, which has as much features but not easy to use."
2027,"Perfect app! Extremely intuitive and easy to use, but at the same time delivers really well developed statistics. It helped me a lot to track and manage my budget. No annoying ads even on free account. Especially grateful for that!"
2028,"Main thing is great support on syncing to international banks (not just US). Android and PC/webapp are responsive and laid out cleanly. Easy to see your info and find what you need. For suggestions, I hope they add the ability to mass-edit transactions across accounts (possible now if in one account) Also, add 2 user fields for each transaction (for custom payee and notes), separate from the synced details and current tags. And last, more detailed info on the bank sync/login credentials status."
2029,"tried many, this one has it all. i used to use excel to manage my personal finances and wanted to switch to an app with similar functionality i had set up for my budgets/finances in spreadsheets, while also looking pretty. tried spendee for a week and purchased a subscription bc i was v impressed! disclaimer: there is a bit of steep learning curve using the app, but once you figure out how everything works, it performs wonderfully."
2030,"Great app that has managed to give me an insight of my expenses. I've used many similar apps but this one had that easy-to-use interface, while not losing anything in terms of quality, which made me keep it as my one and only expenses tracker üòÅ"
2031,"Used in team for a year. The best part is that we can co-working with team to register all bills and expenses for each work site. Had many problems when used on old phone (Note5), but all gone when change new phone to Note10. Think more Ram of mobile phone (4GB+) is most important to use this app."
2032,"Two words ""Amazingly Simple!!"" Tried almost all the budgeting /personal finance apps available for AU, none of them (including Spendee) correctly categorised my transactions. But when I downgraded to the plus plan and started entering data manually - I noticed that Spendee is on a completely different league. Love it. Great job guys!!"
2033,"Awesome app! Helps perfectly to keep track of every coin I spent. It takes a week or so to get use to writing everything down but ones you get used to it, it's fine. I recommend this to everyone I talk to for longer than 10min"
2034,"I'll update this review as I spend more time with it.. but so far, it isn't as laggy as the recent reviews are claiming, so I guess they've patched the issues. Exactly what I was looking for, a straight forward spending tracker."
2035,This app is very good for tracking your spending. Even on the free version you get powerful tools such as being able to quickly access your spendings with the help of the widget. Very handy and useful to have to track all of your spendings.
2036,"One of the best application to keep track of the expenses. The best thing is it is user friendly and robust. Also, the web version is available too. Little bit disappointed due to new UI changes and compulsory dark mode. The dark theme is little bit annoying. Please make it optional."
2037,"I love it. Using it for 2 years already. The only thing I can say is that the animation after picking the category is going very slow on android (p20 pro), kind of like freezing upon closing."
2038,"Simple, intuitive, and easy to use. I love the wallet sharing (member) feature, it makes the family financial become easier to manage. Please add feature for credit card tracking and management (set limit, payment alarm, etc.)"
2039,"Spendee has been great for me and my wife, serving as a simple way to conveniently track it expenses. The category icons make reviews of our monthly spending a sinch and the map features and other little customizations get the job done without overloading you with too many customization options. A great simple budgeting app!"
2040,Very easy to use. This is exactly what i was looking for in an app (ability to enter wide range of expenses in different categories and ability to enter monthly salary). Thanks Spendee team!!
2041,"It's a life saver, thank you for this amazing app. That said, I really want to buy the lifetime version but it's kinda expensive, and the upgrade to premium in-app suggestions comes up way too many times it's kinda annoying."
2042,"Not the best expense tracking app (yet), but probably the best European solution. Still some little flaws. But they are working on a webapp, which is an important feature for me!"
2043,There were some difficulties getting the app to sync with my bank account but I wrote an email to to the support and got a prompt response. They fixed the issue in a couple of days and I'm pretty happy with the app so far! The ability to sync with your bank account makes it really easy to manage everything.
2044,"Very useful app for keeping track of expenses, income, wallet. I use it in a simple way and that is all I need atm. The ability to add, remove and edit categories is one of the best features of the application."
2045,"New update sux. The visual is ok, modern. But why you would remove widget and calculator is just impossible to understand. I have been using the app for years and know that you are constantly trying to make things better but this one is a disappointment. Don't want to ruin your rating so I'm gonna put 5 stars just for old days. But plz fix it."
2046,EDIT AND UPDATE: I have solved my problems with email support and with the latest app update. The sync feature with my banks and all features are working well now and I haven't had any issues for a week. Special thanks to Eliska from the support team.
2047,"I need more icons for my categories, would it be possible to create my own and use them? I would add with different dogs for my 2 dogs!"
2048,Great app for keeping day-to-day track of personal income and expenditure. Easy to use. I also love the import feature on the desktop version for uploading multiple expenditures.
2049,"I love this app.. but since mid January, sync was not working. They have fixed issue in iOS app today. But app will forcefully log you out and ask you to log in again. This will lose all unsynced data. So take backup!"
2050,"Spendee is one of the best and easy to use finance tracking apps for simple tracking of transactions and spending. I use the free version and track my expenses and income manually. Even then its a great app, not cluttered at all and no ads to annoy you. Amazing."
2051,This app helped me a lot to track my expenses and improve budgeting. It's very user friendly and the support is great! I had some issues and they solved them ASAP. I totally recommend it!
2052,"Great budgeting app, helped me and my wife to budget together. Thank you spendee!"
2053,Excelent√≠sima aplicaci√≥n para controlar tus ingresos y gastos. Sus estad√≠sticas seg√∫n rubro igual de excelentes.
2054,"The app works with an acceptable speed again, after changing my phone to a newer model"
2055,Current version of spendee is horrible. It's very slow and transaction not getting updated.
2056,Good
2057,"Well, I must say, it's working as expected now after the latest update. Thanks guys!!"
2058,"I stopped using the app but decided to try again. The problems they had are gone, so I'll stay now! New version is nicer, I am missing the touch id, but it will be hopefully bakc soon."
2059,I want to share a wallet with my wife but can't find it. Please help me - she must be premium user too? Can we also share our bank account?
2060,"I need more icons for my categories, would it be possible to create my own and use them? I would add with different dogs for my 2 dogs!"
2061,"I stayed away from the app as they didn't support my bank. They added a bunch more banks recently including mine, so I can finally use it. Seems good so far."
2062,I have been using it for almost 2 years. Great application.
2063,Great. There are many options to customize for your needs. I like the way they have designed.
2064,The app is great but I can't connect bank. I wrote email to the support and I am still waiting for help. For manual tracking perfectly ok.
2065,"The app was SUPER slow recently! Don't know what they did, but it's so much faster now. I can finally use it normally."
2066,We use Spendee to pay off our student debt with my husband. Hope we get there soon. Thank you Spendee.
2067,"Very good! This app is easy to use, beautiful icons and easy access."
2068,"It has all the features I need, including making budgets. Free version is pretty good too. Do recommend"
2069,Absolutely awesome it is value packed and is great for stats and easy to use very customizable
2070,It work is efficient! I'm using it to manage my store's cash flow. I wish I have an option to add another one to manage my salary.
2071,Very useful and feature rich app that is constantly updated. Many thanks to the developer.
2072,Great app! This is where i can update expenses using different device much more easier and up to date
2073,I have been using this app for a couple of years now. Works smooth and gives me what i need.
2074,It's convenient and accurate! What else do you need? : ) It makes keeping accounts so much easier and on the go
2075,"Although I have experienced some issues after initial release of v.5, for several months now the app works okay for me. On the contrast, I had sync issues with v.4. Recent update 5.0.28 seems to make the app faster as well. It takes up to 5 seconds to load for me, which I think is, well, normal for an app. Maybe it all depends on the phone being used, but I have not experienced most of issues that others have for a long time."
2076,"App is good.. but lately they have removed the average daily expense from the dashboard, it was really helpful for an insight."
2077,"Recent update to v5 was a struggle, but looks like Spendee team is managing it already. Submitting a transaction was a pain after the update, but it got fixed! Good job. It would be a pity to migrate to another budgeting app and now I don't have to."
2078,"Very useful, thanks for the development team prompt response for the recurrence function issue."
2079,Recommeded
2080,I updated to the latest version and it seems like most of the problems that have been mentioned have been resolved. Good job!
2081,"Good way to track our expenses there is a bug in the latest update. When I try to change the date while updating the expenses, the dates are not shown it's fully blank."
2082,"It was way easier & faster in the previous version. Now the +, -, x, √∑ doesn't even work while entrying a transaction"
2083,Now it's not possible to add Pin code or use the biometric authentication
2084,Good App üëçüëç
2085,good
2086,"I loved Spendee on my IPhone, it worked wonderfully and I think there is no other money app like this one to compare. But on Android (Xiaomi) the app is full of bugs and less efficient and with worse work flow than the one on IOS. I must say their customer service is great and they helped me with everything, but I am loosing my patience with all the bugs that are appearing. I would quit using it if there was any app to change."
2087,"Absolutely amazing. I've tried many finance tracking apps over the years, and finally found the one. It integrates with the bank, so you can import every transacion in every account (current, credit, etc) in your bank, going back as long as the bank allows (10 months in my case). It allows you to create manual accounts, to represent other sources that can't be tracked. It understands transfers: money that you move from one account to another (paying the credit card, for example). And much more!"
2088,"I have a lifetime subscription. Have to get more used to the new interface, but I like it pretty much. I like the detailed view of the cash flow and the graphs and I love the dark mode. It is a bit slower but it's still the best app for personal finance tracking. Keep it up guys! :)"
2089,"Great app, easy to use and flexible"
2090,I love this app
2091,I like new version features and outloking. But application speed should be better. Older application was working faster
2092,"After update ver.,Where is the widget ? please get it back"
2093,"Just deleted old bad review which I left before when spendee had performance issue. I loved spendee but I never left review before, but I left it as soon as I faced issue. Now I realized that it's not a good manner as I used Spendee for many years without complaint. Although I am not using spendee for now bcz It's not good fit for me since the major update released, I believe Spendee is still the best for many ppl. Cheers!"
2094,I am also thinking about trying other apps coz last update UI wise was ok but it made app really really slow. Cant do anything without 2-3 seconds lag and reloading Edit: App is fixed now and seems fast again. Rating 5 stars
2095,Finally its faster now please make it more faster thanks
2096,"I've been using this app for some time and I love the simplicity which helps you track your finances. The app overall works fine even with the new update, a bit slow sometimes after this update but overall works perfect for me."
2097,"Using Spendee since 2015, and I love it! Because of the App's UI and functionality, as well as excellent customer service. Although it is slow now, I will wait for you to optimize it~"
2098,I am so disappointed that I may have to change the app because it became too slow after the update and I will lose all my saved transactions since 2016. I wish u fix it quickly guys I love this app. Also add the calculator and widget pleeeeeeease.
2099,Changing my review as you changed your app's overall user experience. The latest update REALLY WORKS for me! üòä
2100,I've tried many finance apps... This is the best I've encountered so far.
2101,The app is working right now. Changed my review
2102,The updated spendee is very slow whats wrong?
2103,Updated on 15 Jan 2021 Thanks for the follow up respond from development team. It works now. üëç --------------------------------------------- It was very handy when I could use both app and webpage. But now the webpage has shown temporarily read mode only since last Oct although it said it will be back to normal after mid November. Hope this issue can be fixed soon.
2104,Deleted the app and reinstalled..seems to be fine now
2105,It's really amazing and helpful
2106,Loving the new version. No issues so far.
2107,"I've been using Spendee for five years now and I like that the team continues to improve the app. Even though the last major update had problems at the very beginning, I now already see changes going in a good way. And I like the update overall! Being a developer myself, I can understand the struggles the team can have at the moment, so I'm waiting with patience and I still think Spendee is the best expense tracker out there."
2108,It's Easy..Simple.. üëçüëçüëç
2109,Good
2110,Very nice app.
2111,"One of the best application to keep track of the expenses. The best thing is it is user friendly and robust. Also, the web version is available too. Little bit disappointed due to new UI changes and compulsory dark mode. The dark theme is little bit annoying. Please make it optional."
2112,Excellent app. User friendly
2113,Love the app!!!
2114,Thanks to the support for retrieving my lost transactions
2115,Best app so far keep up
2116,"I'll update this review as I spend more time with it.. but so far, it isn't as laggy as the recent reviews are claiming, so I guess they've patched the issues. Exactly what I was looking for, a straight forward spending tracker."
2117,Lovely üåπ
2118,Very useful
2119,The current version lf android is worse. Please roll it back üôè Its not syncing data from my other device and UI is so confusing
2120,"I used this app for 3-4 years now, daily. The last update sucks. The new UI is nice, but every time i open the app, the app loads for 8-10s. I only gave you 1* so i can get your attention faster. Please fix your (used to be) awesome app and i'll change my review back to 5stars. Edit: do we have a clear date when things will be fixed? Edit2. I'll leave 5* for the past 4 years. Thanks for everything Spendee team! Im out now"
2121,Pro : Best design and UI. Cons : No feature to transfer between wallets & no overview for all wallet. Please give feature to transfer between wallets and overview for all wallet in next update.

2127,After update the app can not start
2128,"New update sux. The visual is ok, modern. But why you would remove widget and calculator is just impossible to understand. I have been using the app for years and know that you are constantly trying to make things better but this one is a disappointment. Don't want to ruin your rating so I'm gonna put 5 stars just for old days. But plz fix it."

2151,Excellent app for keeping control on spending
2152,"Greatest apps ever. I don't have any comments on the apps. It just a great apps. I think they have their own server because if I record the expenses, my friend also will get the notification no matter where they are. However the pro version price is quite expensive for me because u need to pay every month. If the price is only one-off payment, maybe I will consider to purchase it to support."
2153,i really love this app. very very useful. Waiting for more exciting updates on this app.üòòüòçüíñ Just want you guys to put option to view expenses spent for other months individually.. i could only see 3 option under *group spending summary* 1.this month 2.last month. 3.all time So if you could modify bit that will be so helpful üòÄ Thank you

This stuff can get really complicated really quickly without good management, and that can lead to harsh feelings among friends splitting expenses, so relying on this app to do all the work means more good times and fewer headaches."
2165,The app is just mind-blowing for managing expenses. The options while entering a shared expense are just perfect. The recent UI overhaul was very welcome and much needed. More than expectation was delivered there. Cheers to the developers! The only thing the UI falls short of is a dark mode. I think the app will be truly complete when that's added.
2166,Best app to manage home expenses and similarly holiday trip expenses. We can log expenses and allow app to calculate and eventually settle accounts
2167,"overall very good app however following points needs to be addressed: 1: It only gives person wise payable/receivable, However if i need to Know total amount i paid or total expense charged to me there is no option. 2: There is only option to see group total for current month or previous month or total. However if i want to see total for a specific period, there is no option. 3. For groups add admin option.Where one will be selectedadmin, others can add expenses but will be approved by admin."
2168,"Very helpful for settling up the accounts on trips, contri parties,etc. Very fascinated by the algo used by this üî•"

2181,Super app working smoothly and satisfying the requirements.
2182,"best app ever!! i use it everyday, before this app i spent a lot of dayly hours writing down spends, support services, recurrent services for a list of clients, now i can trust that everything will be on this app..."

Currently using with my partner. But always use for traveling. And also for organising parties. Maybe one day I will try the paid version. My weekly commitment from The Five minutes journal today was to leave a review on a product or business that has changed my life for better. Thank you, Splitwise!"
2216,Awesome. Helped a lot to manage amounts with friends
2217,"Best app out there for keeping track of the amount spent. It can be used on a trip or as a daily expense group. It's simply the best. I had given it 3 starts earlier due to the repayment process which was too complicated. After the developer told me about ""Simplify Group Debts"" feature, I've got no issues/complaints."
2218,"Amazing app, I just wish there was a Zelle integration (like the one with Venmo)"
2219,"Excellent app I've been using for many years now. The recent design overhaul is refreshing and actually improved the UX. One of the few apps I pay for, even though I'm not using the premium features often. Kudos from a fellow app developer."

2225,Really good way of keeping track of finances in a shared house
2226,"One of the most useful apps I have seen for splitting payments, easily with only a click of a button. Allows for many different methods of splitting equally/unequally. Easy to get new people on board and invited to your group. Only could do with an improvement to allow removing people (within the group) from a split payment. Also could allow do with a ""split the the rest equally "" button."
2227,Really good application for personal uses And better then other app.
2228,"It's a great app for taking notes about tour spendings, mainly If tou haver a group of people which tou share bills and other expenses with.

Literally a life saver, even better when recording expenses for groups greater than 2. The new UI looks great as well. Everything seems modernized and streamlined. UX is fantastic."
2233,"What an amazing app, even better with the update. I am using the free tier, as it is enough for what I need and I am really grateful for it. It has become invaluable on the group trips. And extremely useful on the daily basis for shared expenses. Please add dark mode."
2234,"The app made the whole trip so stressfree! No matter who spends, all can be entered on the app in a few clicks and it splits it automatically. The simplified pay option is a real life and time saver! Going to use it for daily commutation too now! Would like to see more payment merchants integration. Kudos to the creators!"
2235,The latest update is irritating. Not at all user friendly and it hangs. Hope it improves soon.üôÑ
2236,Simply the best. This makes group trips and apartment living so much easier and less stressful for everyone. It links up really nice with Venmo and has a clean and smooth interface. I would highly highly recommend this app to anyone who has to split costs or plan a group trip of any kind.

2250,My roommates and I constantly struggles to keep track of who owed what to whom. Splitwise makes this process unbelievably easy. Cannot recommend this product enough.
2251,"Best app, but anyone can settle up balance of anyone in same group. It will lead to misunderstanding so please provide such a arrangement so that only money receiver can settle up the balance."

2329,This is the best app i come across. Now i do not need to write and remeber all my credits and expenses. I simply add owing expenses in the app. The UI is also good and convenient to use. ***** for sure üëç
2330,Made my life easy üíô
2331,Nice app to split your bills‚úåÔ∏è
2332,This is an awesome app you want to speak your expenses between your friends and you want to join here and there and you don't want to pay all. This is a perfect for this purpose. However I do wish you offer a pitch Black theme for AMOLED displays.
2333,Good
2334,Must have for keeping tab of expenses while travelling in a group
2335,User friendly
2336,Have used this app for more than an year and it has been really helpful. Splitwise helped us through all the way when we 4 of Bachelors were staying in an apartment.
2337,"I love this app. I use it to split expenses with large groups or individual friends. It's super easy to use and makes breaking everything down a breeze. This stuff can get really complicated really quickly without good management, and that can lead to harsh feelings among friends splitting expenses, so relying on this app to do all the work means more good times and fewer headaches."
2338,Awesome app
2339,brilliant! exactly what I needed for house budget!
2340,Best app for your circle of friends. No need for you to be the dedicated accountant anymore!
2341,Best tool in trips
2342,"Easy to use, stable app, reliable"
2343,One of core finance app in my phone. Must have. Using this app from 2015 till now (2021) trasaction and balance have never been incorrect.
2344,Very nice app I have been using from 4years.
2345,5 star app the best of its kind
2346,5 star for the bunny feature.
2347,Love it....and super user friendly
2348,Very good apps!
2349,It's a good app...
2350,Perfect! Works as intended!
2351,The best expense tracker app.
2352,"Big fan of this app - it spells things out in easy to understand terms. If you want to make an impulse buy you can check the app and easily see if you can afford it while maintaining financial stability. This app is great!! Thank you for creating it and its continued development. Update 07/01/21: This app is still going strong, very helpful for me! Citibank has some issues syncing sometimes but always catches up in a day or two. Thank you!!"
2353,"This app is absolutely fantastic! They are continuing to add new features as well, and I love the fact that you can use it free, pay for a subscription, or do a one time purchase for the app. So I bought it and plan to use it for the foreseeable future. There was a couple integration bugs, but their support team was actually able to get a member of the development team to fix it. I wanted to write more, but shout out to Alex from pocketguard, he gave me an amazing customer experience!"
2354,Definitely one of the better budget apps I've used and stuck to. Only issue I have is it doesn't update my accout immediately and can take a minute to. Otherwise it suits my needs perfectly.
2355,"I've been keeping a spreadsheet budget for years and just started using the app on January. The export function is great, really complements my existing system."
2356,I've been looking for a budgeting app that's versatile and functional and this one's pretty great.
2357,"Always struggled budgeting until we got this app. Now its much easier for my wife and I to hold each other accountable for our spending and be aware of what's going on. Some aspects are a little clunky...I wish you could edit categories for pending transactions, and if I budget for a bill it seems to be double counting it in my ""cash available""."
2358,"This is the first budgeting app to successfully connect with my credit union app. So glad I can start automating my budgets. Also love the ""do not include in calculations"" button for each transaction. We use a credit card for all our purchases (points, baby!) and counting every purchase and every credit card payment would make it look like we're spending 2x as much as we are."
2359,"Love the way this app categorizes my transactions for me. If it guesses wrong, I can always change it, but it's usually right. It also gives me a list of upcoming charges based on my history so I can plan my budget for the month. Super intuitive and easy to navigate. Would definitely recommend this app. for budget-challenged people, like myself! üòé"
2360,"For only around $100 for a lifetime membership, PocketGuard is a steal compared to a lot of other budgeting apps. It's also very well suited to creating your own categories and adjusting the details of your purchases. Can't recommend enough!"
2361,"Love seeing all my transactions and balances in one place, love getting my bills lowered with the Billshark feature. This is really helping me to spend less and make sense of my bad money habits so I can fix them."
2362,"Good app but hasn't worked in two weeks, even though I'm a paying customer and haven't received a reply to my email describing the issue. Update: fixed"
2363,Best app for track your monthly. It is sync with bank account too and organize your spends/invests by categories automatically! I wish i could open a manually cash wallet too.
2364,"Great overall application, I do think the user experience around budget vs upcoming bills could be improved but this is an incredibly useful app."
2365,"I love how easy it is to use, how it encompasses every account I have, and allows.memto check every account in one place."
2366,I love this app. It is easy to use and has all the functionality I need to manage my money. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
2367,"Extremely fast sync between bank and app, very easy to useüëç"
2368,Great way to track monthly expenses
2369,Has helped me a ton to finally set up and stick to budgets!
2370,"Really amazing for both budgeting (making a plan) and tracking (executing the plan). It does a really great job of showing you what is coming up so you can see how safe it is to buy something. Right away I can see on the app how much disposable income I have. Perfect. And it's not crippled by a paywall. I haven't yet discovered what all the premium features are, but the basics of budgeting are there."
2371,"Helped me to organize my finances and achieve the savings goal. I like the monthly projected amounts as well as the daily ones. Top institutions sync almost in the real-time, but the smaller banks aren't. Also, there is an option to manage a cash account and include transfers to the calculations. Multiple affiliate programs and some of them were helpful There is also a web version which is very helpful when you need to adjust pockets or rename vendors. All in all, the app is extremely useful for daily use; it's not excessive and hence, not time-consuming; has the beautiful interface. It's a pleasure to see a free product of a high quality. Amazing service from people who love what they do."
2372,"So far, I love this app. Linking bank accounts is really easy, and the tracking of income and expenses is smart and intuitive. What I like most is the ""in your pocket"" financial status summary to help me spend only what I have. The ability to hashtag transactions is clever and useful, too. Overall, these guys have done a good job making money make sense."
2373,"Extremely useful when you have multiple credit cards and want to have your spending categorized and tracked. The categorization is mostly fine, the rest can be adjusted. All the transactions can be labeled with a note or a tag which makes the search very simple. Also, the tags can be used to group unrelated transactions and see totals for them. There is an option to see a breakdown of the transactions as well as a pie chart for a specific card apart from for all the accounts together. Some of the data can be reached from several screens which also saves time."
2374,"My favorite feature is what they call In My Pocket. The name really speaks for itself! I have this projected amount at the beginning of the month, so I know whether I can afford an extra dinner with my friends or set aside more for buying a new device. It's much better than just comparing your income with category budgets (which are also available in the app). I use them only not to overspend within in my pocket amount."
2375,I like that I can get an overview of all my accounts whenever I want
2376,"Great so far. I would have given it a five except the transactions seem to lag behind and don't download into the program in a timely manner. I have the transactions through at the bank, but they won't show up on the app. Too much of a delay. UPDATE: I found out that my transactions were moving slower due to a merge. More importantly, I received immediate customer service directly, and they helped me to fix the issue. The service was immediate responsive and listened to my needs. That is why I moved from a 4 star to a 5."
2377,"Powerful, simple, intuitive budgeting app I've used all of the major budgeting apps, mint, YNAB, and more. they just start getting too complicated which means I end up not using them. Pocketguard does all the heavy lifting but still keeps me involved, the hashtags make it easy to get reports, and the web app does just what I need when I don't want to stare at my phone. the only thing I'm missing is printable reports. they give you the reports you just can't print them. I pair this with qapital."
2378,"So far, I'm loving this app. I've downloaded and deleted at least 4 other budget apps. All I wanted was a simple, organized look at my bills and spending habits. Every other app complicated the process, so it took me hours just to link my accounts and set up my profile, only to find irreconcilable issues and being at square one again. I haven't had those problems, this app is easy and straightforward, takes you step-by-step through the process so you understand each function."
2379,"LOVE THIS APP! I downloaded a lot of different budgeting apps, but this was, by far, the winner. It connected seamlessly to my bank and allowed for very easy modification of debit entries. I also like that it can ""remember"" how you want a type or merchant transaction classified as. There is some manual modification, based on my spending patterns, but I really don't mind."
2380,"Really great app. Bank account linking actually works. No need to manually update transaction pull, it does that automatically. Would be nice to manually add accounts/investments that are not found in their search inventory (private company investments). I've tried to utilize the ""In My Pocket"" feature but cant get it figured out. I use the pro version so access to everything. Create transaction categories, cash income/expenses, recurring bills/income."
2381,"One of the few money management apps that properly and consistently syncs with bank transactions and other financial institutions. The tech support is fantastic too -- was able to fix a sync error with an investment account and actually followed through with the support ticket. Intuitive and intelligent budgeting. Love the way bank transaction categories are ""memorized."" Lots more. Highly recommend. üëç"
2382,"Came here from Mint. Mint may have a few more features, but PocketGuard's quality is beyond anything Intuit has put together. I would consistently run into synchronization issues and transactions not showing up and now I get notifications that my credit card had a high transaction go through, which is the complete opposite of what I had prior. Mint is entirely free and PocketGuard's Premium is $4/month, but I'm happy to pay that for an app that I don't have to reset every month."
2383,"Great app, intuitive and helpful. Makes it easy to see recurring charges from the same merchant, and has helped me identify several recurring charges that were duplicates, and cut costs by removing subscriptions we didn't need. Only thing missing is an ability to project forward what each account balance will be based on recurring income, recurring bills, budgets, and current balances in each account. The data is there, just need to do some calculations and show it visually. contact me for info."
2384,"I switched to Pocketguard from Mint, as I found I wasn't getting the value I would've liked. Very happy with my choice. Super easy to use, simple to understand and fit what I was looking for in a budget app perfectly. The mobile app doesn't feel like a worse version of the website. What's more, I was unable to link one of my accounts to the service. After some time with their support, I'm able to track the account, and they gave me a free month of premium. Above and beyond customer support!"
2385,"Pocketgaurd makes it easy to budget, it's one of the few that auto-adds all of your transactions so you don't have to record every thing you buy. Would highly recommend, especially if you aren't great with money. One thing though, I wish I could edit my monthly budget without my changes carrying over to the next month. Sometimes I overspend on eating out, I'm fine adjusting my budget, but I don't want to plan to overspend every month. Let me fix my budget without changing next month's goals"
2386,"I've had the app for a few days now and it's wonderful! I tested through 7 apps altogether and this one has the best app/online interface (and looks the prettiest). The free version doesn't really offer a budget feature, though. If that's what you would like to have, you'll need to pay for the membership, but it's worth it if you can save money better."
2387,"PocketGuard has been great for my budgeting and spend tracking. The app offers way more than that, like if you're bigger on setting goals or reminders for paying bills they have that ability. It's very non intrusive with any forms of advertisement or 3rd party suggestions. You have to specifically look or push for suggestions in how to save or change trends in your spending before pocketguard brings up any sort of offer or advert. Small detail but I love the UI and visuals. Very modern and sleek"
2388,"i dont rate apps often but seriously this is a great app! very easy to use, thorough, and the customer is always quick to respond and very helpful. I've offered suggestions and they actually implemented them! ive tried about every budgeting app out there and i deleted them all once I got into this one. seriously, give it a shot!"
2389,"Has the potential to be the best budgeting app, and they are constantly improving. They really take your feedback seriously when you email them. The features are awesome for visualizing your spending. The duplicate transaction issue is getting better finally and whenever it does happen, I just don't count the transaction. It's almost perfect!"
2390,"Awesome App. This app calculates exactly how much I have available to spend, taking into account the next pay cycle also. I have most of my bills due at the end of the month, so I have to set aside some money from the first check to cover expenses at the end of the month. This app does this automatically. On top of this, I get paid biweekly, so the actual date I get paid is different every month. The app knows exactly when bills are due and what days I get paid, so I won't overspend."
2391,One of the best apps I've used. Please keep everything the way it is. I'm a PLUS customer and I love how real time everything is. that was the major selling point for me. All these other apps are slow and dont communicate well. I downloaded and tried at least 10 other companies. Sticking with pocket guard.
2392,This is by far the best money tracking app I've ever used. after Level Money got shut down I tried at least a dozen other apps but couldn't find anything similar. Every other app wants to overcomplicate things and this is just simple money in/money out system. My only complaint is I can't seem to get the tagged transactions function to work and it shows up blank which is fine becuase it's not a 100%necessary feature
2393,"Finally found the budget and savings app I was looking for. Tried literally all the other options but always failed to combine the features I needed. Pocket Guard does this perfectly. Bank sync is quick and no delay, savings built in (although specific goals to contribute to would be a great addition), gives me a full review of the state of my financial situation. Premium is comparable to the price of others. Also had an issue with functionality and developers resolved it on less than a day."
2394,"This is exactly what I wanted--a bare bones, simple budgeting app that is super easy to use. I especially like the hashtag feature that let's you track expenses and compare them with expenses from past months. It really helps me see where I tend to overspend. Glad I found this!"
2395,"I'm always adding my money all the time, guessing high to try and keep track of how much I'm actually saving each month, this honestly makes it easy. The best part is when you go to add your bills is syncs with your bank and shows you everything that comes out. All you have to do is drag and drop!"
2396,"I've had this for 3 months. I was very cautious choosing an app. I didn't want to waste my time on something that would be complex, time consuming and eventually useless. My expectations have been exceeded! It's simple, fast, intuitive, and already it's helping me understand where my money is going! So glad I found it!"
2397,"We really enjoy using this app as you can use the same login/password and access Pocketguard from different devices. Would like some more features for family budgeting, but it's obvious the app wasn't designed for it initially. But it's a great way of improvement."
2398,"I love the easy to use interface, which also has a cleaner look than other apps like this. it's great to have complete control of your finances. from keeping track of your accounts to setting up spending budgets it easy and convenient. I recommend getting this app!"
2399,"I love this app! I usually think I need to write down everything I bought myself but with PocketGuard's bank linking technology, I no longer have to worry about recording eveything. It's super useful and I highly recommend this app for budgeting and for finding new ways (provided by PocketGuard) to make and save money"
2400,"I really enjoy this app I can customize it and I made several other categories such as door dash and Amazon, PayPal and those types of purchases go directly into there so I can see exactly what I Spend on top of the other given categories. I really enjoy this app and it broke down everything for me. In a really nice way That I could see months back and see good and bad spending trends of mine."
2401,A nicely done app which has everything I really need for budgeting. I also suppose that would be useful to have the total spending limits amount and compare it with income. It's definitely on the most used feature so I hope you will make such improvement.
2402,"The app tracks all my spending: eating out, sports, shopping etc. Everything is categorized and displayed in a simple way so that I don't need to spend much time looking for a specific transaction was made a month ago. Very handy."
2403,"It's been 2 weeks using this budget app. As of now what I like about PockGuard compared to Buxfer and Mint, is the breakdown of the estimated money per day, week and month. It also informs you when a bill has been paid. I am a visual person, therefore, the pie chart is a PLUS."
2404,"I've just started to utilize this app and it looks great so far. Very nice feature with the hashtags. I need to track my expense for multiple categories at the same time. The net-worth screen is fine, but I would also like to add my motorcycle there."
2405,"I've been using this app for about 2 or 3 years now, and I can't recommend it enough. They've been adding new features the whole time and know what is useful. Great for those that have automized bills and have a predictable income, but it's versatile for many more financial situations. Saving money is so easy with this app."
2406,"Outstanding app. I've been using it for a year after accidentally came across it in the app store. I switched to other apps just to try something new. But PocketGuard constantly improves their service! Great job, keep up!"
2407,"I've been looking for a good cash flow budget app for years! Most budget apps don't account for fixed bills, savings, and debt reduction goals. Instead, they say you have a ton of money ""left in budget"" when actually your landlord hasn't deposited your rent check. This calculates that and lets you know how much you ACTUALLY have available for groceries, entertainment, etc. It's a little spammy with suggested partners, but other than that a solid tool."
2408,It was very important for me to stop overspending and start saving up money. Pocket Guard was the first app I came across and thankfully I've downloaded it.  It worked for me as I'd expected and now you have another loyal customer!
2409,"Easy to setup and shows me what I need to see: After bills, how much I can spend that month. I've tried every other budget tool and they are complicated and time consuming to manage. This one is really easy to setup and use and so far I'm loving it."
2410,This app is really easy to use and clean. There is a paid option which I may go for soon that includes a digit/accorns type saving functionality. However I cant commit to it until those features have been added. super excited for their arrival!
2411,"Works really well for me because it shows how much money is left at any point and what bills are left to pay. Took me a little time to figure out the setup and get expenses organized, but works well now."
2412,"Loses sync with one of my banks, but so far its the most bank compatible one I've found. This is the app I'm daily driving. It's really close to being exactly what I need, there are just a few tiny things I would change if I could"
2413,This is the best budgeting app I've ever used. The visualization and automated categorization of transactions is exactly what I've been looking for. Customer service has been very responsive and the team is constantly making updates/improvements.
2414,PocketGuard has helped me budget successfully. Last year I asked their dev team about the ability to split a purchase into multiple spending categories and now the feature has been rolled out! PocketGuard is a great app for tracking where your money's going.
2415,"This app has helped keep everything in check. I can see how much has been spent in a budget category easily, so I know whether I can spend freely or more restricted before I shop."
2416,"Love the option to see your future income and bills. Even more, your budget is also completed with planned savings for the month. Of course, they provide the ability to track your progress."
2417,"Helped me to see a picture of my monthly spending and it's was an incredible experience as I've never had any similar apps before. I definitely need to reconsider my spending habits and hopefully, PocketGuard will assist me in it."
2418,"I've been looking for an app that will help me and my spouse to track our spending and project the money we can set aside for the trip. Pocket Guard has all the essential features and an amazing look, so we are completely satisfied with it."
2419,Easy to use. Less confusing than Mint. Snap shot of finances for planning. Great tool for those who want to see where their money is going and how much rhe can spend each day.
2420,"Very easy to interact with the app. After utilizing the products of some other competitors, I must admit that PocketGuard team has a great sense of balance between interface and operability."
2421,"I use it only for tracking my spending and I am happy with the app. The app perfectly calculates my total spent including every transaction I make, however, I would like to have a little more extended charts."
2422,"This budgeting tool helps me to save my money day in, day out. I use all the features PocketGuard offers with no exceptions and I am sure there are lots of ways making it much better."
2423,1 week in and I've already cut my spending! I love how nice this app puts all my finances in one spot and help me cut unwanted spending. I do wish it had autosaving which they are working on. Excited to see what I can save with the app!
2424,Keeps everything in one place. And provides awesome additional services starting from cutting your bills (!) to get a life insurance. Glad to see that in special tabs so the interface is free from adds.
2425,"I was able to connect all essentials types of accounts I use like banking, loan and investing. However, was unable to connect a billing account. However, it's not really of importance so I give you the five."
2426,"We have been using PocketGuard for a year. Regular improvements, accurate calculations, great support made this app one of my favorite ones. I cannot imagine my life without it now"
2427,Use to use Mint. This is SO much better. Connection to the bank is SO MUCH more stable and up to date. Thanks back end developers for doing such a great job. (Front end devs did a good job too )
2428,"Smooth UI, practical, and very helpful insight into how I spend my money. It's really started to help me get to my goals just by being better informed."
2429,This app helps give me a better visualization of my income vs bills. It's been a real game changer for me to better structure my finances. Convenient and easy to use. I was apprehensive to link my bank accounts but this is a trustworthy app that truly helps. Thank you!
2430,"Great for keeping track of my expenditures and monthly spending limits! Allows me to categorize and label expenses, and unlike Mint, PocketGuard actually saves those category designations and applies them to future purchases."
2431,"Excellent finance tracker app. Great features, very responsive customer support, and excellent app layout/usability. I would even consider paying for premium - only $35 a year."
2432,It's the best budgeting app I've been able to find. Most intuitive software and it's easy to navigate and edit. Very impressed and very pleased!
2433,"I work in finances, and I find this app to be one of the best budgeting apps that I've personally used. I recommend that my clients and everyone keep track of there finances."
2434,A budgeting app needs to work with how you think. I've tried several and this was the first one that functions in the way we spend and budget money. I'm so glad I found it!
2435,So far so great! Really helps put my finances into perspective. I live the freedom I have with what I can put in but appreciate the automated things too. The featurea are great!
2436,"Good tool for budgeting, tracking expenses, setting goals, and bill payment reminders. All in one place! The paid version is worth the $."
2437,"i like the very simple design, i dont need extra detailes features, just show me the numbers! but i think they need go make the ""in your pocket"" number customizeable to your own pay date."
2438,"In the beginning, I was unaccustomed to stick to In My Pocket, but then I realized it was much better than using common budgets only. Now it helps me to stay on track."
2439,"Easy setup and use, right to the point w/out fluff, easy to categorize and customize categories, like custom notifications and easy to see current category totals, look forward to full release so i can share it w others"
2440,"Great app, was able to easily sync my accounts while mint and other could not do or kept giving connection errors. I love how easily it was to figure everything out."
2441,Nice automated budgeting app. Don't need to reset or enable my budgets and goals at the beginning of the month as the app does it itself. No superfluous movements.
2442,"Easy to use, great interface. The break down is easy to understand and keeps your accounts separate unlike other apps."
2443,Great app!!! I wish I could pay bills with this app or schedule a payment with this app but I am still giving it 5 stars because it's awesome!!
2444,The best app for expense tracking and accountability! I love it so much. I just wish we could add hashtags to pending payments and create budgets.
2445,"Helps me to track my income and expense from multiple accounts. Allows me creating category budgets and custom reports. Also, there is an option to track cash."
2446,"Excellent budget app! Combines the flexibility of both zero-based budgeting and no budget approaches, bringing everything in a simple and clear way."
2447,Excellent app for trakcing finances. Easy to use and see exactly how much and where your money is being spent and where you can try to save more.
2448,"It took some efforts to set up all my bills, but I am very pleased with the result after all. I have accurate numbers at the beginning of the month and this definitely helps in planning my spending."
2449,Simple and easy to use but still has plenty of customizability if getting a Plus account. Tried many other budgeting/bank tracking apps and can't emphasize how much recommend this one.
2450,"Awesome app. Exactly what I was looking for. Less budget focused, more focused on what I have spent and on what. Highly recommended"
2451,"overall, very happy with this. It's good for tracking, monitoring, and review the movement of your money in your various accounts"
2452,"Big fan of this app - it spells things out in easy to understand terms. If you want to make an impulse buy you can check the app and easily see if you can afford it while maintaining financial stability. This app is great!! Thank you for creating it and its continued development. Update 07/01/21: This app is still going strong, very helpful for me! Citibank has some issues syncing sometimes but always catches up in a day or two. Thank you!!"
2453,"I've been keeping a spreadsheet budget for years and just started using the app on January. The export function is great, really complements my existing system."
2454,Definitely one of the better budget apps I've used and stuck to. Only issue I have is it doesn't update my accout immediately and can take a minute to. Otherwise it suits my needs perfectly.
2455,Best financial app.
2456,"This app is absolutely fantastic! They are continuing to add new features as well, and I love the fact that you can use it free, pay for a subscription, or do a one time purchase for the app. So I bought it and plan to use it for the foreseeable future. There was a couple integration bugs, but their support team was actually able to get a member of the development team to fix it. I wanted to write more, but shout out to Alex from pocketguard, he gave me an amazing customer experience!"
2457,I've been looking for a budgeting app that's versatile and functional and this one's pretty great.
2458,Great way to track monthly expenses
2459,I was able to get what I need from this ap and support for it was even better. Thank you for your help
2460,Best app for track your monthly. It is sync with bank account too and organize your spends/invests by categories automatically! I wish i could open a manually cash wallet too.
2461,"Love the way this app categorizes my transactions for me. If it guesses wrong, I can always change it, but it's usually right. It also gives me a list of upcoming charges based on my history so I can plan my budget for the month. Super intuitive and easy to navigate. Would definitely recommend this app. for budget-challenged people, like myself! üòé"
2462,Coool
2463,Has helped me a ton to finally set up and stick to budgets!
2464,"Love seeing all my transactions and balances in one place, love getting my bills lowered with the Billshark feature. This is really helping me to spend less and make sense of my bad money habits so I can fix them."
2465,Best all round financial tracker
2466,"This is the first budgeting app to successfully connect with my credit union app. So glad I can start automating my budgets. Also love the ""do not include in calculations"" button for each transaction. We use a credit card for all our purchases (points, baby!) and counting every purchase and every credit card payment would make it look like we're spending 2x as much as we are."
2467,"Great overall application, I do think the user experience around budget vs upcoming bills could be improved but this is an incredibly useful app."
2468,"For only around $100 for a lifetime membership, PocketGuard is a steal compared to a lot of other budgeting apps. It's also very well suited to creating your own categories and adjusting the details of your purchases. Can't recommend enough!"
2469,I love this app. It is easy to use and has all the functionality I need to manage my money. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
2470,"Extremely fast sync between bank and app, very easy to useüëç"
2471,"I love how easy it is to use, how it encompasses every account I have, and allows.memto check every account in one place."
2472,"Good app but hasn't worked in two weeks, even though I'm a paying customer and haven't received a reply to my email describing the issue. Update: fixed"
2473,I'm having a great time! It's helping me think and plan my finances better!
2474,I like that I can get an overview of all my accounts whenever I want
2475,Great app!
2476,"Always struggled budgeting until we got this app. Now its much easier for my wife and I to hold each other accountable for our spending and be aware of what's going on. Some aspects are a little clunky...I wish you could edit categories for pending transactions, and if I budget for a bill it seems to be double counting it in my ""cash available""."
2477,Good
2478,Super easy to use and extremely helpful for budgeting and planning.
2479,"I really enjoy this app I can customize it and I made several other categories such as door dash and Amazon, PayPal and those types of purchases go directly into there so I can see exactly what I Spend on top of the other given categories. I really enjoy this app and it broke down everything for me. In a really nice way That I could see months back and see good and bad spending trends of mine."
2480,Helped me learn to budget
2481,Great!!
2482,"Excellent budget app! Combines the flexibility of both zero-based budgeting and no budget approaches, bringing everything in a simple and clear way."
2483,"Great so far. I would have given it a five except the transactions seem to lag behind and don't download into the program in a timely manner. I have the transactions through at the bank, but they won't show up on the app. Too much of a delay. UPDATE: I found out that my transactions were moving slower due to a merge. More importantly, I received immediate customer service directly, and they helped me to fix the issue. The service was immediate responsive and listened to my needs. That is why I moved from a 4 star to a 5."
2484,Excellent app helps out a lot for my budget.
2485,"Great app, really enjoy every feature!"
2486,"Pocketgaurd makes it easy to budget, it's one of the few that auto-adds all of your transactions so you don't have to record every thing you buy. Would highly recommend, especially if you aren't great with money. One thing though, I wish I could edit my monthly budget without my changes carrying over to the next month. Sometimes I overspend on eating out, I'm fine adjusting my budget, but I don't want to plan to overspend every month. Let me fix my budget without changing next month's goals"
2487,Great way to budget. I like the average dollars per day feature so you have a target to stay within each day.
2488,Pretty happy with this app so far. Very detailed and easy to understand. Alert of when ive gone over my alloted spending for each category keep me in check
2489,"Easy to use, nice and simple"
2490,"Works really well for me because it shows how much money is left at any point and what bills are left to pay. Took me a little time to figure out the setup and get expenses organized, but works well now."
2491,"Helpful, easy to setup, great for financial spend tracking and budgeting"
2492,Great way to track spending !
2493,"Has the potential to be the best budgeting app, and they are constantly improving. They really take your feedback seriously when you email them. The features are awesome for visualizing your spending. The duplicate transaction issue is getting better finally and whenever it does happen, I just don't count the transaction. It's almost perfect!"
2494,"Finally, an app that picks up all my accounts and is very accurate in real time"
2495,So far I really like this app! I can see how much I could spend and not affect my bills
2496,Simple and straight forward. Best solution for me.
2497,Easy to setup and use. Simple user interface.
2498,Excellent App!
2499,Very helpful
2500,"Awesome App. This app calculates exactly how much I have available to spend, taking into account the next pay cycle also. I have most of my bills due at the end of the month, so I have to set aside some money from the first check to cover expenses at the end of the month. This app does this automatically. On top of this, I get paid biweekly, so the actual date I get paid is different every month. The app knows exactly when bills are due and what days I get paid, so I won't overspend."
2501,It helps me understand a budget and helps me decipher between spending money on things I want and things I need
2502,PocketGuard has helped me budget successfully. Last year I asked their dev team about the ability to split a purchase into multiple spending categories and now the feature has been rolled out! PocketGuard is a great app for tracking where your money's going.
2503,"Loses sync with one of my banks, but so far its the most bank compatible one I've found. This is the app I'm daily driving. It's really close to being exactly what I need, there are just a few tiny things I would change if I could"
2504,"Awesome app. Exactly what I was looking for. Less budget focused, more focused on what I have spent and on what. Highly recommended"
2505,"Great app, intuitive and helpful. Makes it easy to see recurring charges from the same merchant, and has helped me identify several recurring charges that were duplicates, and cut costs by removing subscriptions we didn't need. Only thing missing is an ability to project forward what each account balance will be based on recurring income, recurring bills, budgets, and current balances in each account. The data is there, just need to do some calculations and show it visually. contact me for info."
2506,Pocketguard support team went above and beyond to figure out and correct my synching issues and as of yet it appears to be fixed.
2507,The only app that will work with my bank account
2508,Great app for budgeting and spending tracker
2509,Excellent app for trakcing finances. Easy to use and see exactly how much and where your money is being spent and where you can try to save more.
2510,The app is more flexible to customizing for my preferences
2511,Great app for organizing bills!
2512,Great application
2513,So far so great! Really helps put my finances into perspective. I live the freedom I have with what I can put in but appreciate the automated things too. The featurea are great!
2514,This app is great for keeping track of my budgets and knowing how much $$$ I have available to spend.
2515,Great app with easy to use layout!
2516,Use to use Mint. This is SO much better. Connection to the bank is SO MUCH more stable and up to date. Thanks back end developers for doing such a great job. (Front end devs did a good job too )
2517,Simple and exactly what I needed to manage my money.
2518,Best
2519,Pleasant.
2520,I really do like this app. My wife was skeptical aftering using similar apps but this one change her opinion.
2521,Just get it. Its free and helpful. I've paid down more cc debt than any other popular budgeting app.
2522,"I've had the app for a few days now and it's wonderful! I tested through 7 apps altogether and this one has the best app/online interface (and looks the prettiest). The free version doesn't really offer a budget feature, though. If that's what you would like to have, you'll need to pay for the membership, but it's worth it if you can save money better."
2523,This app is awesome. Way more features that I thought!
2524,Super easy to use and gives you alot of features for free
2525,"No complaints, helps me stay on top of my money by showing me how much I have 'in my pocket' everyday, week and month"
2526,Best Budget App for Android.
2527,"Really amazing for both budgeting (making a plan) and tracking (executing the plan). It does a really great job of showing you what is coming up so you can see how safe it is to buy something. Right away I can see on the app how much disposable income I have. Perfect. And it's not crippled by a paywall. I haven't yet discovered what all the premium features are, but the basics of budgeting are there."
2528,Keeps track of my budgetary expenses. Reminds me when my payments are due. Love it.
2529,Very savvy. 6$ a month is worth it.
2530,This is the best budgeting app I've ever used. The visualization and automated categorization of transactions is exactly what I've been looking for. Customer service has been very responsive and the team is constantly making updates/improvements.
2531,So far I have found the app useful. I have not had any technical issues and it is helping me to organize my finances.
2532,This is an easy to use app that shows you all if your transactions and breaks down your spending. It also shows you exactly how much money you have left to spend that month so you don't go over your budget.
2533,Pretty useful! I'm mainly using it for the goals
2534,So far great app....
2535,A budgeting app needs to work with how you think. I've tried several and this was the first one that functions in the way we spend and budget money. I'm so glad I found it!
2536,Very helpful and easy to use.
2537,"Great app, was able to easily sync my accounts while mint and other could not do or kept giving connection errors. I love how easily it was to figure everything out."
2538,"I work in finances, and I find this app to be one of the best budgeting apps that I've personally used. I recommend that my clients and everyone keep track of there finances."
2539,"This is the budgeting app I've been looking for! It's all about the ""In my pocket"" feature."
2540,Love how easy this app is to use. It's definitely helped me be more mindful about my spending.
2541,"Easy to setup and shows me what I need to see: After bills, how much I can spend that month. I've tried every other budget tool and they are complicated and time consuming to manage. This one is really easy to setup and use and so far I'm loving it."
2542,Little confusing setting up at first but great as you learn the app....
2543,"Really great app. Bank account linking actually works. No need to manually update transaction pull, it does that automatically. Would be nice to manually add accounts/investments that are not found in their search inventory (private company investments). I've tried to utilize the ""In My Pocket"" feature but cant get it figured out. I use the pro version so access to everything. Create transaction categories, cash income/expenses, recurring bills/income."
2544,"It's been 2 weeks using this budget app. As of now what I like about PockGuard compared to Buxfer and Mint, is the breakdown of the estimated money per day, week and month. It also informs you when a bill has been paid. I am a visual person, therefore, the pie chart is a PLUS."
2545,This app has helped me save money. It is easy to use as well.
2546,Awesome
2547,Fantastic budgeting tool! I absolutely love what it offers!
2548,"So far, I'm loving this app. I've downloaded and deleted at least 4 other budget apps. All I wanted was a simple, organized look at my bills and spending habits. Every other app complicated the process, so it took me hours just to link my accounts and set up my profile, only to find irreconcilable issues and being at square one again. I haven't had those problems, this app is easy and straightforward, takes you step-by-step through the process so you understand each function."
2549,Perfect for me and I will be going plus soon
2550,A+
2551,The UI is much cleaner to use than Mint. They also don't have ads all over the place like Mint. I wish I had switched earlier.
2552,"So far, this is the best free budgeting app I've ever used. Up to date, accurate information, very clean and precise design, many useful and handy features, and customizable interface buttons, too! Let's hope they continue providing a quality product!"
2553,Great way to keep a budget with my wife. Was using Mint earlier and I like this interface a lot better
2554,"One of the best apps I have discovered to get my hubby and i on the same page financially. I highly recommend it, especially for newly weds."
2555,"Still glad that we have this app.. it has been helpful over time managing expenses.. much easier communicating about finances than before!! This has been a great way to help me and my brother manage/split expenses after inheriting property, etc. It allows us to communicate about expenses - old, new, what's been paid, what needs to be paid and all while we are living in different areas. We were trying to make it happen on spreadsheets but this is so much better. So glad we found it!!"
2556,"Fantastic to have one app for all of my accounts, my husband and I love it. I downloaded the app so that we wouldn't have to constantly talk about our balances or upcoming bills. Now all we do is talk about ways to save, and how we plan to invest in the future. This app has helped us go from financial fear to confidence."
2557,"So easy and convenient!!! I wish there were a payday option but other than that, it's super helpful to help my husband and I communicate about our finances, especially because he's working away from home at the moment."
2558,"GREAT overall financial tool. Track everything in 1 location. See and PLAN what your financial health will look like. Add bills, track income, even see your retirement picture grow. Easy to use"
2559,"My husband and I have been using Honeydue for over a year now and I thought it was time to review. Its simple and easy to use after you have it all set up. This allows us to have a shared app with all our recurring expense due dates and amounts. It even shows whats expected to come out for each week so you can easily calculate leftovers for spending and saving. Just the act of setting this up together has opened the door to increased communication, trust, and goal setting in our relationship!"
2560,"Great features and option! Helps us keep all our accounts, credit cards, loans, retirement, and investments in one easy to read app!"
2561,"Best budgeting app I've found so far, out of about 10 I've tried. Great categorization, easy addition of accounts, and most importantly, they make you feel like your feedback is actually listened to and possibly implemented."
2562,Easy to set up and use. Helped me and my wife better communicate and coordinate our spending.
2563,Budgeting was tough for us and always felt like an argument until we got this. I'm impressed so far Edit: It's still great a couple months on. Definitely recommend
2564,"An excellent app for budgeting, and the dev team was very responsive when I ran into a small issue, even as a free user"
2565,Honestly love this app. Been using for almost two years now and has been a huge help for me and my partner as we made the transition to living together
2566,Great app that allows me and my partner to keep track of who paid for what
2567,"Amazing experience. It's easy to set up. My husband and I have our account linked and can view both. We can mark which bills are paid and who paid them. There is lag time on the update of the account balances of banks. But, I check my account multiple times per day, so it's OK. Editing bills is easy and you can label each our have for what it was. This is the way you can track you spending and budget. It's been one of the best things instead of having to update a spreadsheet."
2568,"I put all my bills, amount and due dates. This app will send you a reminder a few days prior to the bill. Has a paid box and skip bill option. And you can add a partner so they know what's due and how much. Etc"
2569,Great app! Allows you to auto import and categorize transactions from your bank accounts. Editing transactions is easy and the categories are customizable. Intuitive interface. Facilitates communication about finances.
2570,"Love this app! It's especially useful since it gives you notifications when all of your bills are due, which is really handy for the ones we have on autopay. (We use a different app for budgeting and only use this one for keeping track of due dates and amounts of upcoming bills, and it's fantastic for that.)"
2571,"Great app support, quick responses. Functionality is awesome. Easy to chat with hubby regarding bills. It's really helping keep us within budget as you can set spending limits, customize categories and alerts. Good articles and budgeting tips."
2572,Super user friendly. A great way to show all of my accounts and a way for both me and my husband to see where we are at in our budgets. I have tried other apps but this one is my favorite.
2573,"Need a little personalizing for it to work best because everyone's spending habits, categories, budget etc are different. Overall great app. Helps me to keep track and organize expenses."
2574,"Mostly easy to function. I had some issues on how to add a transaction to my bank, but I eventually figured it out! I wish you didn't have to type in a name for each transaction either as long as it's in a category. Everything else is GREAT. We used to use Money Lover, but failed to keep my husband and my apps synchronized. Our apps would show different totals... and when dealing with money, you don't want that! Since we both have our own account, all items are updated on both of our screens!"
2575,"Fantastic app. I had been looking for something that offered this level of functionality for some time. A clean and efficient way to stay synced on finances with my wife. The ability to share all, some, or no info for individual accounts is excellent. We are very open about finances but let's be real, I don't need alerts popping up for her about my last Chick-fil-A visit on cheat day. Happy to tip monthly for something I get such value from. Keep up the good work and consistent improvements."
2576,"For just being released this year Honeydue is an EXCELLENT service. I've looked at so many budgeting apps this year and nothing has helped me and my fiancee get a grasp of our financial situation like this. High on my feature request list would be the ability to add financial goals (car down payment, wedding), and the ability to factor my savings goals into my budget. Otherwise I'm VERY excited to see where this goes. PLEASE, I beg you, do not put more ads or affiliates in the app. The one thing that ruins all other financial apps is seeing a bunch of low-key promotions for partner's credit cards or loans. I would much rather pay a higher subscription or 'tip'."
2577,"I really am enjoying this app with my husband! It's great to have access to pay bills together yet keep finances seperate. That's our new choice, which can be intimidating and confusing, but this app has brilliant articles on how to do it fair and makes sense. That's just the tip of the iceberg in regards to what this app offers. üòä There are MANY more financial articles, tips, info, etc. to help assist and inform anyone. Very user friendly interface as well. Great job @HoneyDue!üëå"
2578,"I'm thoroughly impressed with this app. There IS somewhat of a lag for balances etc but it always seems to update on a regular. I honestly haven't had any major issues with this app to report and barely anything minor. It gives me a great idea of my spending, savings and how I can improve paying debt or saving more on a broader scale."
2579,"I think this app is exactly what couples need. The days of sharing an account are over. Men and Women married or not are still independent to a point. This helps bridge that gap with transparency at your rate. With no fees! Just tipping which I have to say, I did almost immediately once my wife was setup. Money can be the most common dispute between relationships. Honeydue is doing a great job in tackling that head on."
2580,"So this is my second review... I couldn't edit the other one for some reason. I LOVE this app, but as I saw someone else mention, I wish I could change the start/end dates per month. My husband and I both get paid once a month on the 20th so our budgeting starts on the 20th and ends on the 19th of the next month. If that could be edited it would be amazing!"
2581,"SUPER helpful, budgeting can be difficult because it can be hard to remember every little thing that needs to get paid for and such, this app makes everything super organized and easy to see so you know exactly where your money is going and where you can improve and have more control over your own spending. I wish I had found this app MUCH sooner"
2582,"This app is absolutely amazing when it comes to joint finances. The only problem I've encountered is certain important transactions can't be put in autopay because Honeydue cards are considered prepay cards. I don't know if that's something that can be programmed on Honeydue's end. It's quite annoying for that reason, especially if you're having your paychecks direct deposited."
2583,It's a relief to know keeping track of bills and due dates can be simple!
2584,"Update -- App is crashing much less so I have upgraded from 4 stars to 5. original review -- I appreciate this app a lot. For being a low cost option for budgeting it is perfect. My occasional frustration has to do with the app crashing randomly. Of course there can always be more. However, it is meeting our needs -- helping my partner and I get back on track with budgeting, getting out of debt and saving for the future."
2585,Great App to have with your significant other. When you want an easy way to to store multiple cards and banks together! It's nice to have a joint account together but also keep your old personal bank account. This let's you ease your way into a final merged account once your both comfortable with one another's spending and savings habits. It's like a test run.
2586,"Very happy with the app so far. Setup was super easy, data displayed is useful. A few more ways to view data on spending and income would be useful (yearly summary, set a budget, etc), but quite pleased with the services offered so far. And its 100% free, with optional tips you can give the developer."
2587,"I'm still learning the app. It seems easy enough, but doesn't work out an actual budget. it brings over the amounts that you pay out on bank accounts, but doesn't put the transactions into the right categories all the time. I was looking to find an app that will help manage what we spend on a regular basis. I'll keep this one for awhile longer to see if I can make it work. thank you."
2588,"The UI took a coyple days to get used to but my husband and I love it! It does a good job of tracking purchases and setting up 'budgets' for the month. It also lets you split a single transaction in multiple categories (aka budgets), which is really useful for when we go to a store and buy various items together (groceries, home goods, otc drugs... etc)"
2589,FINALLY! An app my husband and I can use to both see the bills and our spending. My husband would use his debit card like crazy and I would pay bills and we would not know what each would of us were doing. Which left us with a low balance. I love this app. When I have a question they respond so fast and extremely sweet. It does take some getting used to when you first add your accounts but afterwards pretty simple. Refreshing could use some work but I think it's my accounts and not the app.
2590,"I love this app for keeping track of my bills. My husband also has it so he can see the bills and balances even though I'm the one who does all the finances & budgeting. Ot syncs with both my bank account and hia phone very quickly. My only gripe is that I can't change when the week resets. Friday to Thursday makes more sense since Fridays are payday for most people (including us). Overall a great app, 10/10. üòä"
2591,"Great couples' budgeting ap! I waited 6 months to rate Honeydue 5 stars, and they deserve them. My knowledge of my true financial situation has drastically improved. Every bank, credit and loan account I have can be monitored from one place. The bills calendar keeps me from paying late fees and lets me see ahead of time when the lean times will be. All of the information is easy to share (or not share) with your partner, even if they don't do any of the budgeting work themselves."
2592,"I love this app. it makes it so easy for me and my husband to communicate about Bill's. It let's us know what's upcoming, paid, past due, etc.... we can check bank balance, loans (student loans, car loan, etc) best thing I've ever downloaded.. we both can add Bill's or make changes... dont have to change back and forth from app to app to know what each other is talking about either. highly recommend"
2593,my sister and I are housemates. we use it to track our expenses but hide bank information from each other. I found other apps to be complicated. wishlist: I just wish I could add a person. we have a third housemate now and would love to include them. I wish I could make partial payments so that it can show who paid which portion.
2594,Finally a money management app that works with Joint Accounts! This is awesome! It allows you to add all your bank and credit accounts and you can even choose which ones are joint and which ones are individual and if you want to share those ones. This is extremely helpful and I recommend it to any couple looking to see and manage all the finances in one spot.
2595,"love that my husband and I can keep track of our finances all in one spot. no more separate bank, calendar, and calculator apps. it even categorizes all of our purchases so we know what we are spending on food, bills, clothing, groceries, gas, etc. every month. highly recommend!"
2596,Great at keeping me and my husband on the same page with our finances especially since he works nights and I work days so we usually only see each other in passing. Convenient and the layout is phenomenal. I dont have to enter the charges every month as you can set it to be reoccurring. This has been a game changer for us!
2597,"Honeydue has made us accountable for our over expenses and helped us to stay in the budget. We now are more aware of what expenses we need to control, when we are more likely to over expend (usually on weekends) and to compare our improvements from past months. We highly recommend it to any couple looking for accountability. Of course, you need to be open to dialogue since overseeing everything you both earn/expend van lead to uncomfortable situations. We actually enjoy it a lot."
2598,"After downloading 2 other apps that weren't very user friendly with involving partner, I decided to try this one. I am sold! It takes a small time investment to get info dialed in, but starting out from the beginning of the month so we can start a fresh cycle and track our true spending. This app is user friendly and I'm excited to be accountable (and holding my husband accountable) for our spending. I love the reaction feature and that you can sync with your banks and loans to see balances."
2599,"Exactly the kind of app I have been searching for. I've tried many other similar financial apps, but they all lack the most important feature for couples who share financial responsibility, a shared view. Now the two of us are on the same page all the time! The bills due feature makes it even better! I no longer have to manage bills in a separate calendar because everything I need is here."
2600,"This app is what I've been looking for. I hope they continue to develop it further. In the short term, I would like a way to export my transactions. That would actually be perfect, simple enough for the wife and I to track throughout the month and do the basics. Then I can load it into my full fledged software to be a dork."
2601,I have used many apps and this is by far the easiest budget app I have found. Not only is it user-friendly but has many options that will keep your finances on track. The only option I dislike about this app is that when manually entering a payment into a balance it creates a new transaction causing duplicate transactions. I have found a workaround this just adding those transactions under the transfers section.
2602,I think its great! Sometimes it doesnt organize expenditures into the right category but other than that its amazing. If you and your partner are looking to understand your fiscal relationship and plan for the future honeydue is the app for you too!!!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
2603,"This app is fantastic! the only problem i had was connecting bank accounts, but honestly that want bad, i can manually add them and i kind of prefer that. its a really nice way to track money and see what we spend where. its nice knowing my hubsand can check it out with ease and i dont have to worry about keeping him up to date."
2604,"Edit: Emailed support and Lucas showed me how to set up custom categories. No complaints at all, now!! Previous: Overall wonderful! The categories for spending are weird, though... I wish I could differentiate groceries from restaurants, for example. Custom categories would be wonderful."
2605,great to stay organize and budget with your partner! this is the only budget app that really works with my partner and I. I have tried other budgeting apps for couples and it just doesn't seem to work as great as this one. I find myself keep coming back to this one!
2606,"Great user-friendly app! it's nice that I can set it up and my husband can see all of our individual and joint accounts w/out all of the separate user names and passwords. My only gripe is that I would like to name categories myself. I'd rather specify ""life insurance"" instead of ""personal & wellness"" otherwise I love it."
2607,"This is the first app my husband and I have LOVED while budgeting together. It offers the perfect amount of information, notifies us of bills, and tracks our individual card changes. My only critique is that we're unable to adjust the way the calendar counts a ""week"" currently it's Sunday to Saturday, however, and option to start our week on payday would make or budgeting more simple."
2608,great for a combined family budget! my husband and I were having difficulty getting on the same page with transitioning to combined finances but separate bank accounts. .. this app has totally saved us when it comes to communicating what bills come due when and which paycheck to pull them from. either one of us can log in at any time and be able to see exactly what we have upcoming!!
2609,"Edit: Great technical support. They reached out very quickly and solved my problem! Using the app now and it is great! /////// The app doesn't open. When I click on the icon, the app's icon appears on my screen and then it just crashes, I have a Pixel 4a. Android Version 11."
2610,I adore Honeydue! It is exactly what my husband and I needed to keep eachother aware and accountable for our spending. It has showed us how much we can afford and where we can save. I just wish it had a function for saving to different goals such as vacation.
2611,"Honeydue has changed how we are able to manage our finances for the better. We are always on the same page, never miss payments, and are able to see all our finances clearly with the ease of their well designed app. Honeydue has helped us to visually see and achieve our financial goals!"
2612,I absolutely love this app. I love that it's free and it's better than paid apps I've had previously. I love being able to see all my transactions automatically classified by category. I love the fact that I can set my budget and get an alert once I'm getting close to my limit. I love the fact that I can share everything with my husband without having to ask him to look at it. This app just made our lives/marriage better.
2613,"My best friend and I got this app together because all the house bills are in my name, but I have terrible memory and he does not. This is now one of my ESSENTIAL apps and I haven't considered uninstalling it once since I've downloaded it. Logging bills and payments due is simple, and you can even categorize what type of payment it is. Not to mention you can hook up all your accounts and it will keep track of your transactions and deposits for a budget. It's all very helpful for my household."
2614,"Although it takes a while to connect my accounts, they were eventually added successfully! This app seems to be exactly what my husband and I need. I wish I knew how to edit the categories (change title, color, icon, etc.)"
2615,"Best App to manage funds and get your bills in order. I was having the toughest time trying to figure out what was due and when and now with this handy app - the guessing is gone. With one touch, I know how much I'm spending and how much I need to save. There are some things I would like added but overall no complaints here! After trying practically every money managing app out there and becoming beyond frustrated, I am highly satisfied with what this app provides."
2616,I like the app because of it's helpfulness with finance management as far as bills go. With the ability to mark what has been paid and all. Plus it being listed by date due and the reminders that you are able to set for yourself in case of absent mindedness.
2617,"I love this app! Helps me keep track of purchases, set a budget for categories and even add my own spending a.d earnings categories! I use with my husband and its helps us keep each other accountable and we can even write little notes to add explanations to items we've purchased just to remind us why we bought something."
2618,"Updated review: Great customer service! I had a problem with the app not opening and the Honeydue team contacted me right away to help. It's running like normal again; definitely a great experience! This is my go to app for bill tracking, does everything I want and need!"
2619,"It's simple to use and free. If you want to support a good cause and have extra cash, they'll accept a payment. Not required for full access!"
2620,"So seamless. Pulls all of our banking information, makes it so simple to categorize purchases and quickly visualize where our money is going. Love the bill feature, helps us to plan for upcoming recurring costs, and the chat and comment features make it so easy and fun to work on our financial planning together!! ‚ù£Ô∏è"
2621,"This app was easy to setup, it integrates with our bank/credit card accounts well, and the notifications are super helpful. I recommend this over any other partner/relationship money management app for the above and because it's tipped based. Other apps feel forceful and this app feels flexible."
2622,"If you are married, this app is fantastic. This app has really helped make it easier to get and stay on the same page financially. My wife and I always used to do a budget and check register on paper. However this app adds in the convenience of always being in your pocket as well as linking bank accounts."
2623,I am also experiencing problems in the last days. The app simply dies when performing certain operations. Using Android 11. Looking forward to that update mentioned below. Thanks for the quick response and fix!
2624,"It's user friendly, has many options with regards to notifying one person/both people using account, and I like that each person in the couple can have an individual profile and choose what to share with their partner (so far as spending as such)."
2625,This app is amazing! It has helped my partner and I to become financially more open to one another. It allows us to organize all of our accounts in one place so that we can see each other's spending habits. It makes budgeting and planning so much easier!
2626,"My husband and I really love this app for communicating, tracking and budgeting for our finances. It has helped us to see it all in one place and be able to make smart goals for our financial future. Definitely recommend."
2627,"I was using a similar app trying to budget all my account and I was not, at all successful. When I found this app it was everything I needed and so simple to use. I was able to see where my money was going so well that I was able to see what I could cut back on and start saving. And after 3 month using honeydue app I was able to buy a house. I'm excited to let my whole family know about this app"
2628,"absolutely love this app. I can track family finances with my husband, add personal and joint accounts, add monthly bills to send reminders. i just wish it would total monthly amounts for me. but adding using the list is very simple."
2629,"My wife and I have been looking for something just like this, to allow us to see and communicate more efficiently on the inflow and outflow of our incomes. This is a great way to be transparent as well as help to organize things! We have been super pleased and use this app daily."
2630,"I love having all accounts (savings, checking, credit/debit cards, etc) in one place, with the ability to specify the purpose of each transaction and have realtime tallies of spending."
2631,really really helpful app to make money with your partner from many storage accounts and can organize and track your Bill's! I love it. wish it updated the pending bank transactions a little bit faster but still really helpful! better then my own banks app by 100!
2632,I would love if it would update more often as we do several transactions a day. Or if there was a way to manually refresh it. Besides that this is the best app where both partners can see what's going on and make changes.
2633,"really good app, I use it by myself now because my wife started tripping. but in my opinion, the app is great for two mature people with a common goal for financial success. user beware - finances are not a game."
2634,Great app to keep track of spending. I've been looking for one that my spouse and I can share information on spending... no longer have to worry about over drafting because of not knowing what each other has spent.
2635,i love this app! it makes it so easy for both parties to see the same stuff no matter where each person while not having to rely on looking at one phone to see the budgets etc. highly recommended
2636,"i have tried them all, save time and start here . This is the best , easy to use and once configured will interface with your bank and make the budgeting process really easy. its really great not to have remember to record expendtures."
2637,Love this app the hubby can see whats going out instead of always asking where money goes now he can see all the bills!
2638,"I've used MANY budget trackers. This is hands down the best imo! I was able to connect, all of my banks, as well as all of my Credit Cards, and even my Fingerhut credit."
2639,I never review apps but am very pleased with this one. Support desk was super helpful getting a stubborn account connected. Love being able to see everything at a glance in one app. The ability to share real time info with my partner is another plus!
2640,Great app to stay on on top of our financial standing together with my significant other. It is easy to use and make changes. Highly recommended for couples!
2641,"A fantastic app for managing budget in a relationship. I've switched from Mint, which used to be the standard bearer for money management. This app will overtake them!"
2642,"This is the first app that has successfully helped me and my husband track all our accounts, debts, and bill payments and we've tried at least 7. I've recommended this to all my friends."
2643,"Husband and I love this app. Let's us keep track of our bills, budget, and split expenses without a lot of effort (we were tracking in spreadsheets before)."
2644,Great app for me and my SO to easily keep track of our finances.
2645,Great tool for budgeting! Downside is sometimes it takes a few days to update balances. But I love using this app with my partner for reminders about upcoming bills and quick balance checks without having to log into my bank apps.
2646,My husband and i use this to stay on top of our bills. We work different shifts so its difficult to communicate everything all the time. Alerts and notifications makes it easy to keep our finances in order.
2647,This app is awesome and so helpfull! Now me and my bf can see how much money we make together and it's so much easier to keep track of what we're spending and our bills!
2648,"Love this app as an easy way to check on my partner and I's finances. Syncing banks, setting up spending categories and sharing bills is a breeze. Great to get away from the Excel spreadsheets to this seamless system!"
2649,"Exactly the app I'm looking for. The only request that I am looking for but not available is that it only track back the transactions 6 months ago, it would be better if it can track back longer."
2650,"I was looking for an app the eliminate the ""what bills do we have before next payday?"" question. This app keeps track of bill due dates & amounts. The calendar view & due date reminders are very helpful. Great for couples/anyone with shared finances."
2651,Great app for families to share account information and keep a budget. Only request is make it easier to log transfers by making it one action instead of creating a withdrawal and a deposit.
2652,"It's everything it says it does! Love it. A little suggestion, you should make it easier to add a transaction from the homescreen. There can be a big ""+"" floating button or something. I'm speaking of manual transactions as I mostly spend cash. Hope you consider this. Thanks!"
2653,"Amazing experience. It's easy to set up. My husband and I have our account linked and can view both. We can mark which bills are paid and who paid them. There is lag time on the update of the account balances of banks. But, I check my account multiple times per day, so it's OK. Editing bills is easy and you can label each our have for what it was. This is the way you can track you spending and budget. It's been one of the best things instead of having to update a spreadsheet."
2654,Dark mode for Android?
2655,Great app! Makes managing budget easy!
2656,Great way to keep a budget with my wife. Was using Mint earlier and I like this interface a lot better
2657,"So far, this is the best free budgeting app I've ever used. Up to date, accurate information, very clean and precise design, many useful and handy features, and customizable interface buttons, too! Let's hope they continue providing a quality product!"
2658,"I put all my bills, amount and due dates. This app will send you a reminder a few days prior to the bill. Has a paid box and skip bill option. And you can add a partner so they know what's due and how much. Etc"
2659,Love it. Very helpful to stay on track
2660,Love it! Incredibly user friendly!
2661,"One of the best apps I have discovered to get my hubby and i on the same page financially. I highly recommend it, especially for newly weds."
2662,"Great features and option! Helps us keep all our accounts, credit cards, loans, retirement, and investments in one easy to read app!"
2663,Easy to set up and use. Helped me and my wife better communicate and coordinate our spending.
2664,"GREAT overall financial tool. Track everything in 1 location. See and PLAN what your financial health will look like. Add bills, track income, even see your retirement picture grow. Easy to use"
2665,"Still glad that we have this app.. it has been helpful over time managing expenses.. much easier communicating about finances than before!! This has been a great way to help me and my brother manage/split expenses after inheriting property, etc. It allows us to communicate about expenses - old, new, what's been paid, what needs to be paid and all while we are living in different areas. We were trying to make it happen on spreadsheets but this is so much better. So glad we found it!!"
2666,"Fantastic to have one app for all of my accounts, my husband and I love it. I downloaded the app so that we wouldn't have to constantly talk about our balances or upcoming bills. Now all we do is talk about ways to save, and how we plan to invest in the future. This app has helped us go from financial fear to confidence."
2667,"So easy and convenient!!! I wish there were a payday option but other than that, it's super helpful to help my husband and I communicate about our finances, especially because he's working away from home at the moment."
2668,Easy to setup and stays connected to accounts I want tracked.
2669,Great app! Allows you to auto import and categorize transactions from your bank accounts. Editing transactions is easy and the categories are customizable. Intuitive interface. Facilitates communication about finances.
2670,It's a relief to know keeping track of bills and due dates can be simple!
2671,Really helps me track my bills so they get paid on time. Easy to use.
2672,"Best budgeting app I've found so far, out of about 10 I've tried. Great categorization, easy addition of accounts, and most importantly, they make you feel like your feedback is actually listened to and possibly implemented."
2673,Honestly love this app. Been using for almost two years now and has been a huge help for me and my partner as we made the transition to living together
2674,"My husband and I have been using Honeydue for over a year now and I thought it was time to review. Its simple and easy to use after you have it all set up. This allows us to have a shared app with all our recurring expense due dates and amounts. It even shows whats expected to come out for each week so you can easily calculate leftovers for spending and saving. Just the act of setting this up together has opened the door to increased communication, trust, and goal setting in our relationship!"
2675,Budgeting was tough for us and always felt like an argument until we got this. I'm impressed so far Edit: It's still great a couple months on. Definitely recommend
2676,"Need a little personalizing for it to work best because everyone's spending habits, categories, budget etc are different. Overall great app. Helps me to keep track and organize expenses."
2677,It is really nice to see my 401K. And my checking account. It's nice to see all of our payments that we wrote.
2678,"An excellent app for budgeting, and the dev team was very responsive when I ran into a small issue, even as a free user"
2679,Great app that allows me and my partner to keep track of who paid for what
2680,The best app!!!
2681,Excellent app!
2682,Excellent app for keeping on top of your finances.
2683,Great app for me and my SO to easily keep track of our finances.
2684,"Great app support, quick responses. Functionality is awesome. Easy to chat with hubby regarding bills. It's really helping keep us within budget as you can set spending limits, customize categories and alerts. Good articles and budgeting tips."
2685,Love this app the hubby can see whats going out instead of always asking where money goes now he can see all the bills!
2686,Makes life much easier.
2687,Great App! Has helped me and my partner lot!
2688,Very useful for me and my wife!
2689,Does a (HONEYDUE DEBIT CARD) come automatically with this app???
2690,Super user friendly. A great way to show all of my accounts and a way for both me and my husband to see where we are at in our budgets. I have tried other apps but this one is my favorite.
2691,"It's simple to use and free. If you want to support a good cause and have extra cash, they'll accept a payment. Not required for full access!"
2692,"Well worth the download, it keeps my wife and myself on the same page and in the know of our finances."
2693,Loveit
2694,A great app for couples!
2695,My spouse and I really enjoy this app it helps keep us on track!
2696,one of the best budget tracking apps out there!
2697,I appreciate how thoroughly I can manage my budget with my partner.
2698,"Love this app! It's especially useful since it gives you notifications when all of your bills are due, which is really handy for the ones we have on autopay. (We use a different app for budgeting and only use this one for keeping track of due dates and amounts of upcoming bills, and it's fantastic for that.)"
2699,So far so good. The auto budget categories are not accurate so I need to actively xha ge them but I don't mind since it forces me to look at my.money and spending budget capacity.
2700,"I'm loving it! I wanted a free app that could help me and my spouse to track our accounts, and that didn't force us to connect to our bank accounts. Honeydue does this, and in a clean, simple interface! Only a couple things bother me, but they're pretty minor. The first is that I can't add a repeated transaction in a manual account. The second is that the money doesn't go directly from one account to the other, it's always through a budget item, and you use a transfer item to represent that."
2701,"Only been using it for a few days, but so far I like it a lot."
2702,Love it. Can't even describe how much I love it. Super easy. No fees with the card plus a virtual card! Seriously the best.
2703,Very easy to use! Easy to keep track of all bills and love that it will give you options to set reminders days before they are due.
2704,Relationship savior :) honestly takes the guess work out of keeping your finances seperated / joining only certain accounts. Very awesome app.
2705,I am also experiencing problems in the last days. The app simply dies when performing certain operations. Using Android 11. Looking forward to that update mentioned below. Thanks for the quick response and fix!
2706,"Edit: Great technical support. They reached out very quickly and solved my problem! Using the app now and it is great! /////// The app doesn't open. When I click on the icon, the app's icon appears on my screen and then it just crashes, I have a Pixel 4a. Android Version 11."
2707,Fantastic customer support! I had an issue and their support team fixed it for me in a few hours over the weekend! Thanks Emma!
2708,I wish there was an option to change the split amount. Instead of 50/50 being able to change it to 65/45 or whatever. Other than that the app works great for us!
2709,"This app works great. Love it, we should all give it A try if you trust your other half."
2710,Great app to keep track of spending. I've been looking for one that my spouse and I can share information on spending... no longer have to worry about over drafting because of not knowing what each other has spent.
2711,Best checkbook app ever
2712,I love this app. Makes budgeting with a partner really efficient and low stress. Definitely recommend.
2713,Great!!!
2714,"My best friend and I got this app together because all the house bills are in my name, but I have terrible memory and he does not. This is now one of my ESSENTIAL apps and I haven't considered uninstalling it once since I've downloaded it. Logging bills and payments due is simple, and you can even categorize what type of payment it is. Not to mention you can hook up all your accounts and it will keep track of your transactions and deposits for a budget. It's all very helpful for my household."
2715,"This app is absolutely amazing when it comes to joint finances. The only problem I've encountered is certain important transactions can't be put in autopay because Honeydue cards are considered prepay cards. I don't know if that's something that can be programmed on Honeydue's end. It's quite annoying for that reason, especially if you're having your paychecks direct deposited."
2716,Excellent and fast Customer service.
2717,Please God make it happen
2718,"I think this app is exactly what couples need. The days of sharing an account are over. Men and Women married or not are still independent to a point. This helps bridge that gap with transparency at your rate. With no fees! Just tipping which I have to say, I did almost immediately once my wife was setup. Money can be the most common dispute between relationships. Honeydue is doing a great job in tackling that head on."
2719,Its very easy to use and efficient way to track your expenses
2720,Love it. Used to use Mint but it was getting complicated. This one was much simpler. Was finally able to get my spouse to use this one.
2721,Awesome app...synced with bank account
2722,Amazing. Is currently making our finances a breeze
2723,"Very useful app, easy to control the expenses."
2724,Fantastic app that really helps my wife and I keep things straight.
2725,This app is a must. I love it. I have been using it for a while now and it has definitely helped me keep track of my bills a whole lot easier.
2726,This app is wonderful!
2727,Excellent!
2728,"Although it takes a while to connect my accounts, they were eventually added successfully! This app seems to be exactly what my husband and I need. I wish I knew how to edit the categories (change title, color, icon, etc.)"
2729,Easy to use Helps a lot.
2730,This is a great app to keep to your budget.
2731,"I like it alot. My grl talked me into it. It is alot of help for couples. Can be improved, but recommend it."
2732,Awesome
2733,Easy interface. Exactly what I've been looking for
2734,"Really enjoy the app, simple and detailed enough. Easy to customize. Hope loans will be supported soon."
2735,Really helps me and my fiancee save
2736,"Honeydue has made us accountable for our over expenses and helped us to stay in the budget. We now are more aware of what expenses we need to control, when we are more likely to over expend (usually on weekends) and to compare our improvements from past months. We highly recommend it to any couple looking for accountability. Of course, you need to be open to dialogue since overseeing everything you both earn/expend van lead to uncomfortable situations. We actually enjoy it a lot."
2737,"It is a great way to keep track of bills. I do wish you could go further ahead then just 1 month, other than that, its great."
2738,Super helpful app for managing household expenses.
2739,Works great for us. It really helps us coordinate to take care of our monthly expenses üëçüëç
2740,Works great keeps all the Bill's added for the week so u know how much is going to be spent that week if u can tip they are worth it but it's all free me and my wife love I th and haven't had any problems
2741,Love the app. Easy to use.
2742,My husband and i use this to stay on top of our bills. We work different shifts so its difficult to communicate everything all the time. Alerts and notifications makes it easy to keep our finances in order.
2743,"Excellent app! I literally tested over 30 Finance apps and this made my top 5. Others include TrueBill, Emma, YNAB, and Prism. Honeydue is an EXCELLENT, Excellent app, and well worth the download!"
2744,Love this app as it is easy to use and allows you to link multiple accounts to it for easy views into them!
2745,Just got my account set up and enjoy using it.
2746,It's very easy to use! I love how organized it is!
2747,Love this app! Easy to use !
2748,Love it! Keeps my husband and I on the same page financially!
2749,So far so AWESOME! Really looking forward to putting this app to use. I think it may be the answer to our financial goals or the very least keep us on track & identify our issues.
2750,"Husband and I love this app. Let's us keep track of our bills, budget, and split expenses without a lot of effort (we were tracking in spreadsheets before)."
2751,"My wife and I have been looking for something just like this, to allow us to see and communicate more efficiently on the inflow and outflow of our incomes. This is a great way to be transparent as well as help to organize things! We have been super pleased and use this app daily."
2752,We have a few different accounts and services to manage. Being able to pull into one place and communicate about short term / long term planning for financial goals and strategy has been awesome. I found the setup to be exceptionally easy and the interface is very approachable and simple to learn. Another thing I really like is being able to switch easily between desktop and app experiences. Overall high quality experience for us - thanks again for designing such a great tool.
2753,My partner and I have many different accounts and so having a single place to view them is very helpful -- I can quickly open the app and see our most recent transactions and account balances in seconds to keep track of our spending. We also love the ability to notify each other of a transaction with @mentioning so that we can clear up what a payment was.
2754,"Love this app! Nice, intuitive, interface. Very timely tech support. Fixed a minor bug while I was on a chat session with them. Also were very attentive to suggested enhancements. I look forward to using this app and seeing it improve. A couple weeks later and this app and customer service people continue to impress. One of my credit cards would not connect. they elevated the issue and got it resolved in just a few days."
2755,"This is the holy grail of couples finance apps. Look no further. My partner and I keep separate accounts, but Zeta allows us to work together as if we had joint accounts. I like their budget system better than Honeydue, because it is more like the popular envelope system. It lets you know how much more money you have left to budget. You're also able to make a personal and shared budget. For example, my partner and I only share rent, utilities, and food, so I can set a shared budget for those and a personal budget for everything else. When going through transactions, you can tag them as personal or shared, so that when you look at the cash flow overview you can see your personal and shared totals. You can split expenses with your partner by opening a transaction and clicking ""split"" and it keeps a running total of who owes who. Then, you can settle up on Venmo with one transaction. I can't tell you how much time that has saved us. You're also able to decide how you'd like to split expenses based on percentage (50/50 or 60/40). If you have a sole proprietorship, this is SO helpful. What I did is create an income category for the business and every sale or expense gets put into that income category. Then, you or your partner can see the net income for your business over any time period you want. MIND BLOWN. These are numbers we were never able to look at before without going through a really tedious process. Now when I look at the cash flow summary, the expenses section only includes personal expenses and the income section shows the net income of the s.p. If you're worried about having bank syncing issues, don't be. Just reach out the support and they can push buttons to make it work for you and they are really helpful. If you like saving for items, you can create a savings category and put money into it. You can put a transaction into multiple categories by splitting it. So, if you want to put 300 of your paycheck towards something, you can do that. Zeta is a little more complex than Honeydue because it has more features and functionality. Their hashtag categories allow for way more flexibility. You can create rules so that transactions are more easily categorized too! It's also completely free!!! I've been looking for something like this for so long. Hopefully this review will help you make the right decision sooner than me."
2756,"I have been using several budget apps for couples and for single too, but there's just always something missing until I stumbled upon Zeta. What I have found that other apps lacking are these things 1. Calculating split transactions automatically based on how you set it up. 2. Budget, Cash Flow, Transactions can be sorted out with All, Personal, and Shared account. These helped me a lot! 3. Bills are outlined/summarized by date aside from the calendar view. 4. Outstanding customer support."
2757,"I just started using this app, and I like it a lot already. I love that this app lets my husband and I easily track our spending and savings together. It's very intuitive, unlike some apps that require a ton of workshops to understand how to use them properly. If it's not easy, I won't use it. This app is easy and it works. So far, I'm very happy with it."
2758,"So far so good. The app has a clean UI and contains most, if not all, the features that the website has.   Zeta is specifically designed with couples in mind, it includes features such as splitting expenses and account categories to deal with shared and individual accounts effectively.   It is in beta, so there are some minor bugs here and there. The staff has been very responsive in fixing anything I've pointed out."
2759,This app has made it easier to track our shared expenses. We have several accounts and it was nice to be able to sync them up and split expenses as they come in. The user interface is clean and straight-forward. They have also been very responsive. It would be great to be able to send money via PayPal or from a checking account in the app.
2760,"I had been trying a few different apps so that I'm able to accurately budget given that I split many transactions, and even a credit card with my partner. This is the first app (including Mint, Clarity, etc.) that actually allowed me to do this joint budgeting in an effective way. The app could have a more streamlined or simplified interface, but overall very happy with the site and app and will continue using. Thanks Zeta!"
2761,"UPDATE: The developer reached out and they're working on resolving the problems. Changing to 5 stars. Love the idea and the features but the app's performance is terrible. I'm on a Pixel and changing the visibility or category of transactions seems to make the UI changes/transitions dependent upon the network requests. As a developer of mobile apps, the performance here would be entirely unacceptable for production builds if this were one of our products."
2762,"This is an incredible group of developers that not only request feedback, but hear what your needs are. The app itself is wonderful! My husband and I use it all the time to better our communication with finances. Thank you Zeta!"
2763,"Loving this app!! My husband travels alot and I'm left in charge of the finances. Both of us being able to see a ""live"" check register and monthly budget is so convenient!"
2764,"If you have a serious partner and you have money and you spend money and you have any sort of long term goals, do yourself and your relationship a favor and integrate Zeta into your money management approach.  I don't mean to sound over dramatic, but Zeta has been a total game changer and I get way too excited about it! I finally feel like my fiance and I have some control over what's going on with our moolah. Not to mention they have a great desktop site that makes sitting down and working on our money together a lot easier than trying to do it on a mobile screen (they are the only couples finance app that we could find that has both).  And on top of all of that, they are also an insanely responsive and helpful team and they are constantly making enhancements to the app and website."
2765,"The app was not updating transactions, but they helped fix that quickly. The Zeta team is very easy to talk to, responsive and helpful! So far, i think Zeta has a lot more going for it than honeydue or honeyfi. I really like having a shared budget AND a personal one."
2766,Great app for budgeting and tracking your finances. Love how they encourage users to work together with your spouse. Easily connects with banks and other money accounts or bills. Definitely recommend!
2767,My wife and I love the app. It makes it easy to be on the same page about our finances. Also the support team was quick to help resolve the issues i was having when i transfered to a new phone. Great app and great support.
2768,My boyfriend & I use this app to keep separate accounts but still easily split expenses. It's super transparent and it even magically identifies monthly bills so that you can easily set notifications. Zeta is the best and easiest app for couple's finance! I'm a huge fan!!
2769,"Zeta is a life saver! its helpe me and my husband communicate so much better over finances, which alway was a sticking point before. The app is great: simple, easy to use and fast. I love this product!"
2770,"Very good budgeting app. I've tried a BUNCH. none of them offer all of the features this one does, and certainly not for free!"
2771,This app is amazing!!! I can't even think of anything bad to say about it. Works well and has all the functionality you need to do banking. Perfect for couples.
2772,"excellent transaction tagging, responsive developers, and granular control over budgets. Everything I was looking for."
2773,"Amazing & easy to use! Just makes sense!! I tried Mint, Spendee, Honeydue & others, but only Zeta provides the clarity & organization that is helpful to real folks. Thanks Zeta! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°+++++"
2774,Love this app. Me and my husband can keep up with everything on separate phones with one account.
2775,"great experience- bugs fixed within hours of reporting them, very personable staff and very well organized app"
2776,Great app really helped me and my new wife be on the same page even though we have separate accounts.
2777,"New to the app, but so far I am loving it. I am also entirely impressed with their customer service rep's knowledge and helpful assistance."
2778,"Zeta is great - haven't found another app that can do what it does - if you have issues, rely on their help chatroom. Kevin is awesome."
2779,I love Zeta! It is a great app for tracking finances
2780,"10/10 would use zeta again. You're free to disagree, just know that your opinion is invalid. :)"
2781,Best alternative to Mint that I've found.
2782,Great so far just got it. Very simple to use
2783,Very good and helpful
2784,Customer service is the best.
2785,"So far, So good"

2787,Nice app!
2788,CORPORATIONS
2789,Love this app. Me and my husband can keep up with everything on separate phones with one account.
2790,"This is the holy grail of couples finance apps. Look no further. My partner and I keep separate accounts, but Zeta allows us to work together as if we had joint accounts. I like their budget system better than Honeydue, because it is more like the popular envelope system. It lets you know how much more money you have left to budget. You're also able to make a personal and shared budget. For example, my partner and I only share rent, utilities, and food, so I can set a shared budget for those and a personal budget for everything else. When going through transactions, you can tag them as personal or shared, so that when you look at the cash flow overview you can see your personal and shared totals. You can split expenses with your partner by opening a transaction and clicking ""split"" and it keeps a running total of who owes who. Then, you can settle up on Venmo with one transaction. I can't tell you how much time that has saved us. You're also able to decide how you'd like to split expenses based on percentage (50/50 or 60/40). If you have a sole proprietorship, this is SO helpful. What I did is create an income category for the business and every sale or expense gets put into that income category. Then, you or your partner can see the net income for your business over any time period you want. MIND BLOWN. These are numbers we were never able to look at before without going through a really tedious process. Now when I look at the cash flow summary, the expenses section only includes personal expenses and the income section shows the net income of the s.p. If you're worried about having bank syncing issues, don't be. Just reach out the support and they can push buttons to make it work for you and they are really helpful. If you like saving for items, you can create a savings category and put money into it. You can put a transaction into multiple categories by splitting it. So, if you want to put 300 of your paycheck towards something, you can do that. Zeta is a little more complex than Honeydue because it has more features and functionality. Their hashtag categories allow for way more flexibility. You can create rules so that transactions are more easily categorized too! It's also completely free!!! I've been looking for something like this for so long. Hopefully this review will help you make the right decision sooner than me."
2791,"I had been trying a few different apps so that I'm able to accurately budget given that I split many transactions, and even a credit card with my partner. This is the first app (including Mint, Clarity, etc.) that actually allowed me to do this joint budgeting in an effective way. The app could have a more streamlined or simplified interface, but overall very happy with the site and app and will continue using. Thanks Zeta!"
2792,We have a few different accounts and services to manage. Being able to pull into one place and communicate about short term / long term planning for financial goals and strategy has been awesome. I found the setup to be exceptionally easy and the interface is very approachable and simple to learn. Another thing I really like is being able to switch easily between desktop and app experiences. Overall high quality experience for us - thanks again for designing such a great tool.
2793,"I have been using several budget apps for couples and for single too, but there's just always something missing until I stumbled upon Zeta. What I have found that other apps lacking are these things 1. Calculating split transactions automatically based on how you set it up. 2. Budget, Cash Flow, Transactions can be sorted out with All, Personal, and Shared account. These helped me a lot! 3. Bills are outlined/summarized by date aside from the calendar view. 4. Outstanding customer support."
2794,Nice app!
2795,My wife and I love the app. It makes it easy to be on the same page about our finances. Also the support team was quick to help resolve the issues i was having when i transfered to a new phone. Great app and great support.
2796,Customer service is the best.
2797,"So far, So good"
2798,Best alternative to Mint that I've found.
2799,"Zeta is great - haven't found another app that can do what it does - if you have issues, rely on their help chatroom. Kevin is awesome."
2800,"I just started using this app, and I like it a lot already. I love that this app lets my husband and I easily track our spending and savings together. It's very intuitive, unlike some apps that require a ton of workshops to understand how to use them properly. If it's not easy, I won't use it. This app is easy and it works. So far, I'm very happy with it."
2801,Great app really helped me and my new wife be on the same page even though we have separate accounts.
2802,Great so far just got it. Very simple to use
2803,This app is amazing!!! I can't even think of anything bad to say about it. Works well and has all the functionality you need to do banking. Perfect for couples.
2804,"The app was not updating transactions, but they helped fix that quickly. The Zeta team is very easy to talk to, responsive and helpful! So far, i think Zeta has a lot more going for it than honeydue or honeyfi. I really like having a shared budget AND a personal one."
2805,"Loving this app!! My husband travels alot and I'm left in charge of the finances. Both of us being able to see a ""live"" check register and monthly budget is so convenient!"
2806,"Very good budgeting app. I've tried a BUNCH. none of them offer all of the features this one does, and certainly not for free!"
2807,"10/10 would use zeta again. You're free to disagree, just know that your opinion is invalid. :)"
2808,Very good and helpful
2809,"excellent transaction tagging, responsive developers, and granular control over budgets. Everything I was looking for."
2810,"UPDATE: The developer reached out and they're working on resolving the problems. Changing to 5 stars. Love the idea and the features but the app's performance is terrible. I'm on a Pixel and changing the visibility or category of transactions seems to make the UI changes/transitions dependent upon the network requests. As a developer of mobile apps, the performance here would be entirely unacceptable for production builds if this were one of our products."
2811,"Amazing & easy to use! Just makes sense!! I tried Mint, Spendee, Honeydue & others, but only Zeta provides the clarity & organization that is helpful to real folks. Thanks Zeta! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°+++++"
2812,"If you have a serious partner and you have money and you spend money and you have any sort of long term goals, do yourself and your relationship a favor and integrate Zeta into your money management approach.  I don't mean to sound over dramatic, but Zeta has been a total game changer and I get way too excited about it! I finally feel like my fiance and I have some control over what's going on with our moolah. Not to mention they have a great desktop site that makes sitting down and working on our money together a lot easier than trying to do it on a mobile screen (they are the only couples finance app that we could find that has both).  And on top of all of that, they are also an insanely responsive and helpful team and they are constantly making enhancements to the app and website."
2813,Great app for budgeting and tracking your finances. Love how they encourage users to work together with your spouse. Easily connects with banks and other money accounts or bills. Definitely recommend!
2814,"New to the app, but so far I am loving it. I am also entirely impressed with their customer service rep's knowledge and helpful assistance."
2815,"Love this app! Nice, intuitive, interface. Very timely tech support. Fixed a minor bug while I was on a chat session with them. Also were very attentive to suggested enhancements. I look forward to using this app and seeing it improve. A couple weeks later and this app and customer service people continue to impress. One of my credit cards would not connect. they elevated the issue and got it resolved in just a few days."
2816,"This is an incredible group of developers that not only request feedback, but hear what your needs are. The app itself is wonderful! My husband and I use it all the time to better our communication with finances. Thank you Zeta!"
2817,"great experience- bugs fixed within hours of reporting them, very personable staff and very well organized app"
2818,This app has made it easier to track our shared expenses. We have several accounts and it was nice to be able to sync them up and split expenses as they come in. The user interface is clean and straight-forward. They have also been very responsive. It would be great to be able to send money via PayPal or from a checking account in the app.
2819,I love Zeta! It is a great app for tracking finances
2820,My boyfriend & I use this app to keep separate accounts but still easily split expenses. It's super transparent and it even magically identifies monthly bills so that you can easily set notifications. Zeta is the best and easiest app for couple's finance! I'm a huge fan!!
2821,"Zeta is a life saver! its helpe me and my husband communicate so much better over finances, which alway was a sticking point before. The app is great: simple, easy to use and fast. I love this product!"
2822,My partner and I have many different accounts and so having a single place to view them is very helpful -- I can quickly open the app and see our most recent transactions and account balances in seconds to keep track of our spending. We also love the ability to notify each other of a transaction with @mentioning so that we can clear up what a payment was.
2823,"So far so good. The app has a clean UI and contains most, if not all, the features that the website has.   Zeta is specifically designed with couples in mind, it includes features such as splitting expenses and account categories to deal with shared and individual accounts effectively.   It is in beta, so there are some minor bugs here and there. The staff has been very responsive in fixing anything I've pointed out."
2824,"I love budgeting apps and have tried several. I found Goodbudget after I left a pro version of another budgeting app. I really like the ease of uploading transactions, find the esthetics of the app to be simple, and think it's a great modern way to do the good ol' envelope system. I recommend everyone to give it a try. Can't hurt, the free version is great and the paid version is risk-free. I also had a good interaction with customer service. He was prompt in responding to my email (24 hours)."
2825,"Ive been using this app for over 8 years now and wouldnt change a thing. Its been saving me thousands a years which is great being a family of ten. Saves you the paperwork too, just wish at had a way where i can save my receipts than it would Heavenly."
2826,"I love this app! It is simple and provides the flexibility to budget the way I want. My spouse and I love that we can both see all expenses and we love having the app share how much we are ahead or behind. It makes budgeting anr saving feel like a game. I like not having it link to our accounts se we are responsible to enter all expenses. It keeps us accountable. Also, it provides the flexibility to budget the way we want rather than being tied to a budgeting program or method."
2827,Fantastic app! It has the smart functions that I expect and love (scheduling/recurring transactions) and it is so simple to use. I was hesitant during the setup stage whether it would be worth it but by golly it is. goodbudget has worked it's way into my every day and I find myself 'waiting' for a transaction to process through my bank accounts so that I can update it into my app. I'll be renewing my subscription every year and doing away with my excel records.
2828,"Great budget tool! My husband and I use the basic free version to track our spending, and it's so easy to use. East setup, easy logging of expenses, and great reports!"
2829,"I love this app, you get so much for it being free! I just have a question, I get paid fortnightly (death of all maths budgets) what is the best way to load monthly expenses on a fortnightly budget? I've tried using goals and I've tried dividing the difference into two forrnights but it never works out, please help? (I prefer a fortnightly budget over a monthly budget)"
2830,Very helpful app for keeping track of spending abd income. Pleasing to look at and easy to understand.
2831,EDIT: See below for original. I emailed and they helped me with my problem straight away. Thanks so much! Started off well but payments into my budget keep getting stuck on pending (wth even is pending??? Serves no purpose in my use!?) And this time has been stuck on it for nearly two weeks. Pretty much given up on it as this makes it useless. Would love this to be fixed and will change my review if so. Thanks.
2832,"Excellent app for 'envelope type' home budgeting. It does require a bit of learning in the beginning, but it pays off, believe me. I only wish I could protect it with a PIN or something. I love the fact that I can use Web interface for larger use cases (editing accounts, envelopes etc.), and use my phone to enter everyday transactions."
2833,"Fantastic. Very helpful way to budget/monitor finances. Definitely worth all the time it takes to set up and hone your budget. Note: Quite a minor thing, and may be just because of the old phone I'm using, but it's annoying that every time the app updates i lose my widget."
2834,"I have now been using this app for 7 or 8 years (back when it was EEBA). I absolutely love it. My husband and I have it on our phones and can easily look and make wise decisions financially. We also have our own envelopes that we can spend money out of without talking to each other. That makes it nice when you just want to pick something up at the craft store. We literally saved over $30,000 and paid off our house in 7 years. Thanks!"
2835,Excellent budgeting app for cross-platform use. both my iPhone-using wife and my Android-using self can finally find a way to keep out budgets in sync without a snag. Free to use and most basic functions are available in the free version. Must have if your trying to use the envelope system (either hypothetically or physically). Keep up the good work guys!
2836,"Been a subscriber for 3 yrs and LOVE it!!! Much better than my custom excel worksheet I was using, absolutely worth the fee for the plus version!! I like that it doesn't auto sync to bank accts. I wanted total control and manually entering everything makes me more aware/accountable of our spending. Easy to update budget/envelopes as things have changed over the yrs. After setting it all up, I now spend 5-10 minutes daily updating for transactions across all our accts, loans, credit cards, etc."
2837,"Best budget app I have ever used. A recent update added multiscreen support. A++!!! It was a major needed feature I and others requested on there support forms. They really do listen to there customs! Now if I could custom a from to a to day on the report in the app like i can on the webpage, this app would be perfect."
2838,"So far, so good! Worlds better than Mint. I've noticed that many of the negative reviews have a common theme - if you're not already familiar with the envelope system, like used by Dave Ramsay/Financial Peace, please watch the helpful tutorial videos for this app. It will make all the difference!"
2839,"I LOVE this app and I love that it doesn't insist on syncing with my bank account. When I write a check, I can take the money right out of my ""envelope"" without waiting for the recipient to deposit it. Likewise, when I take out cash at the ATM, I don't have to take the money out of my ""envelope"" on the app until I actually spend it! Some might call it low-tech but I think it's a miracle"
2840,"Best budgeting app I've used by far. Very quick to load data. Doesn't ask for all of my personal information. Doesn't allow all transaction types from the app (income, debt payments, envelope filling) which is a bummer, but I use them infrequently enough that I can use the desktop version. Much better experience than Mint overall."
2841,Loved it! Tried a lot of budgeting app but this is the only one that works with my budgeting style. I love that it's very much like a cash envelope system so it's easy for me to reconcile and see if I'm over my set budget.
2842,"Ideal budgeting app. I don't want complications, and connection to a bank account, or help with setting up a budget. I need a simple way to keep track of monthly spending with my spouse. This App is absolutely perfect. Kudos."
2843,This app has helped my husband and I to grasp our finances. The 'shared' application is really great because it allows us to update expenses separately but still both see our joint budget. I would recommend this app to anyone who needs help sticking to a budget.
2844,"Best app for the job for me, and I tried a bunch. This was the one that matched best my budget style. Can only say it would be nice to have another theme or two to use, rather than just white/green. Dark theme is too extreme and hurts my eyes."
2845,"Best App for My Family I had used Goodbudget for a few years, and quit using it to try other budget apps. I tried at least 10 different apps and nothing compares to this one. Most of the other apps were hard to figure out and didn't allow split transactions. I'm glad to be back to a very user friendly atmosphere."
2846,I've tried several budgeting apps and this is by far the best! I love the concept of virtual envelopes! The ability to split one transaction into multiple envelopes is such a time saver - it even calculates it for me! Love this app!!
2847,"Good, useful app but I think its time for an overhaul. I think it needs a new look and added features, or make them clearer at least, such as splitting transactions between envelopes or moving money among envelopes. Again, good functional app but needs a bit of an update"
2848,This is a lifesaver. I've used a few budgeting apps. This one keeps evrty th ing simple and at a glance I can see everything I need. I can even plan year long goals. Christmas had a plan emergencies have a plan. Gold.
2849,Honestly the best budget app that doesn't sync with your bank account. Was a bit of a struggle in the beginning but now that I've figured things out it's amazing. Having a we version that syncs with your account is also nice.
2850,"Excellent for straight forward budgeting. Using it to help my 11 year old learn to manage money. Am glad it does not require linkage to a bank account, as he is not ready for that yet."
2851,"Been using this for 5+ years. It's an uncomplicated way to track our ""shopping"" for groceries, gas, kids commission, & fun money. I also have Mint but use Goodbudget to keep our ""shopping"" in check."
2852,We have been using Goodbudget for several years and it has been a game changer. We close on our first house in a few weeks and are almost out of debt except for our mortgage! Thank you!
2853,"What a great budget app!! Once you get the hang of it and learn how to use it, it helps out so much!!!!! Love it!"
2854,"I'm new to envelope budgeting, but so far I like it very much. I find it much easier & useful compared to other budgeting methods. Thank you Goodbudget! :)"
2855,This app has been incredibly helpful for my wife and I to stay on the same page with our budget. The only thing I wish it had was home screen widgets for individual budgets.
2856,I'm very impressed. I used to be worried and wouldn't let myself spend anything because I didn't know what I had and how much I needed to save. But now I know exactly how much I have to spend and it is very freeing. I would definitely recommend giving this a try!
2857,"The icon is so cute. i can have many envelopes, fill them up at start of the month, then monitor their usage, just like watching ur data usage. Thanks devs!!"
2858,So happy I found Goodbudget. I have tried many different solutions and none of them to work for me. This is perfect for what I need.
2859,great app among all the ones i have tried... love it... my wife and I shared the access so we know where we are at all times
2860,"This app has made personal finance for the last 3 years a breeze. Highly recommend purchasing the premium, it's pointless using the free version."
2861,"We have been using this app for about 3 years. It's wonderful. It takes some getting used to and figuring out how to get it all set up, but once you do it's a breeze to use."
2862,Wonderful and convenient app. Keep budgeting and expense track in one. I like it. Rejoice for your great idea.
2863,I love this app. Makes setting up a budget so much easier & keeping track of your money easier too.
2864,I love how this app can help me track my real-lifr envelope budget system. I highly recommend this app to help you guys who want to do very doable budgeting system.
2865,"This is the most practical and useful budget tracker app. in one word, its Awesome."
2866,Easy to learn and very useful. Makes it easy to monitor spending and save up money.
2867,great app to use to know where you are at with your budget while on the go.
2868,Love this app. I've been using it since 2016 to monitor and manage our household budget.
2869,I love this app....I can keep track of almost everything and I kinda know where I stand
2870,Great app and works as expected. I would love to see multi currency support though.
2871,Phenomenal app which employs an ingenious budgeting methodology. Really impressive!
2872,"update: Online setup is much easier. Just getting started, but so far so good."
2873,"Easy to use. 10 envelopes are not enough. but, u can expand for a cost..."
2874,I love the envelope system. It's intuitive to use.
2875,Essential. it's great to have a mobile and desktop application
2876,Very useful envelope budget. Very good.
2877,easy and simple and does the job.
2878,excellent budget and one planning app
2879,Great app to get budget in order
2880,Great product. I've used it for years
2881,simple and useful
2882,Excellent app. Easy to uses it!
2883,Best budget app ever!
2884,Have been using this app for years now and it is the best!
2885,"If theres donate button, I think I go donate rather buy the plus version üòÖ"
2886,helpful app for budgeting
2887,This is everything that Im looking for. Thank you üíï
2888,Nice budget app!
2889,I'm in love with the app.
2890,Sand send my good budget app to my home screen
2891,It's a good budget
2892,Finally have savings and know where my money is going!
2893,exactly what I wanted
2894,Very 1_20_2021 Educationally
2895,"Love the app lots and lots. I use the free version because $45 a year is a bit more than I am willing to pay for an app designed to help you be good with money. I wish it had an ""auto deduct"" feature. I have several bills that are automatically pulled from my banking account and sometimes forget to note it on the app. Absolutely no big bugs or complaints!! Update 2020; Upgraded to the paid version and it's worth the money to track all my bills and accounts easily. Love it!"
2896,"We've used it now for a few years and are miles ahead in our finances. I would say the only real downfall is that if you're going through Goodbudget and rectifying it against your back statement, if you make a change to an amount, or add a forgotten one, it'll scroll all of the way back up to the top. It can be very frustrating if you're reviewing a whole month and it goes back to the top. Other than this, it's a great app."
2897,I have been using this app since it was im beta testing and used to be called EEBA (Easy Envelope Budget Aid). I have never felt the need to look for another personal finance budgeting app. The best thing about this app is that it is dead simple to use while having all the customization options that you'll ever need.
2898,Coming back to edit this. We have now paid for the subscription for 2 years. Love this app. Can't recommend it enough.
2899,The best budget app out there.
2900,Great
2901,Great app that uses the envelope budgeting method. So much for rent or mortgage so much for groceries so much for utilities and etc... Helped me buy a house and a car. Very useful. Plus if you want to know if you paid a bill just look at what you put on your transactions history of not they're assume you didn't pay it if it never showed up in the bank. Useful for helping you learn where your big expenses are that are less obvious on a day to day basis (here's looking at your Starbucks habit)...
2902,Nice app
2903,Love it
2904,Excellent app
2905,"Absolutely love it!! Much better than MINT. Simple but powerful app to track finances. You have to enter transactions manually, but setting up the budget is easy and I love the ""envelope transfer"" feature. Just because ""going out"" budget is empty doesn't mean you can't go, the money just has to come from another category. Great app."
2906,"I've been using Goodbudget for several years now, and it's been so helpful for keeping track of my money. I've been able to notice trends in unnecessary spending to cut back and save for things like vacation and fun, and to give toward causes I support. I love how goal envelopes help me save for long-term expenses. And with scheduled transactions, Goodbudget takes care of my regular payments and fills so I don't have to. The plus subscription is worth it to have unlimited accounts and envelopes!"
2907,"Updating my review... Again, I've used this app for about 4 years and I find this to be the BEST for managing my money. Easy to use, and easy to manage money, 6 stars"
2908,Very nice! dark theme üëè
2909,great overview
2910,Excellent app. Very intuitive and effective. Most of the famous one tend to be overly complicated. This one does expense tracking very well.
2911,We always come back to this app for budgeting.
2912,"I've been using the paid version for a short while now. I am transitioning from Quicken 2017. Quicken has been bloated and buggy for some time now. I finally couldn't take it when the Quicken sync began only working in one direction causing me to constantly track down register errors. Goodbudget seems to work great and is straight forward both on the PC and mobile. In short, it works great! I've been using GB for a few months now and couldn't be more pleased. *update Jan '19* Still great!"
2913,I love this app. We use it with my wife to stay within our budget constraints.
2914,very nice
2915,..but I got there eventually and works for what we need. I told all my friends about it. I especially get excited looking at our goals andhow much money is in or knowing for certain when one debt will be fully paid. I love that my husband and I can both access the app and see how much is available to spend where
2916,[01.2019] On my third year of using.. still useful as before! ------------------ Been using it for a year now.. still one of my most used apps in my phone. Keep it up!
2917,Mantap lah buat ngurus budget.
2918,Great improvements with this version!
2919,Super useful
2920,"I've been using this app/website for several years now. And I love it. It 
helps me stay accountable to my budget. I keep track of my cc debt (that 
I'm paying down)... The only thing I wish I could do is reconcile my 
accounts on the phone. Currently (as far as I can figure out) I can only do 
it online. Update: 11/30/2016 Still loving this app/program. Use it daily. 
Helps me see where my spending issues are. Update: 7/17/2018. Still loving 
it. Still using it every day!"
2921,"Been using this app to create budgets and track daily spending. I have 
everything in different categories and I also have long-term savings goals. 
I do not use the paid version of this app because I don't need it to link 
to my bank account. It's super easy to use and you can set monthly updates 
in transfers and payments into it. I have everything in my bank setup for 
auto bill pay and it makes everything work really nicely. Also I have it 
set to automatically populate my categories whenever I get paid. I used a 
lot of different apps before sticking with this one I really love this for 
my budgeting purposes. I use one other app for a register for my checkbook 
balances. Otherwise this does all of my budgeting and financial needs."
2922,"I use the free version of the app. This is good app for trying to follow 
the Dave Ramsey envelope method without actually having to use cash, which 
just isn't practical for me. I like that I have to manually move the 
monetary amounts rather than it happening automatically (although you can 
schedule transactions if you prefer). It helps me stay accountable and feel 
every purchase just like if I was using cash. The only problem I have had 
with the app is when I tried to use the option for getting paid every other 
week. It was budgeting more money for me to spend than I was actually 
making. To counter that, I now just list that paycheck as twice a month. If 
there happens to be a third pay period in a month I just add that one 
manually. It's worked like a charm ever since I figured out that one little 
issue."
2923,"I have used another expense manager for years, but it lacked the web 
interface and ability to sync multiple devices. GoodBudget had a small 
learning curve to find the best way to use it for what I need, but after 
about an hour of playing with it, I got it and it has worked great since. 
Love it!"
2924,"Ive been using this app for over 8 years now and wouldnt change a thing. Its been saving me thousands a years which is great being a family of ten. Saves you the paperwork too, just wish at had a way where i can save my receipts than it would Heavenly."
2925,I'm in love with the app.
2926,"I love budgeting apps and have tried several. I found Goodbudget after I left a pro version of another budgeting app. I really like the ease of uploading transactions, find the esthetics of the app to be simple, and think it's a great modern way to do the good ol' envelope system. I recommend everyone to give it a try. Can't hurt, the free version is great and the paid version is risk-free. I also had a good interaction with customer service. He was prompt in responding to my email (24 hours)."
2927,"We've used it now for a few years and are miles ahead in our finances. I would say the only real downfall is that if you're going through Goodbudget and rectifying it against your back statement, if you make a change to an amount, or add a forgotten one, it'll scroll all of the way back up to the top. It can be very frustrating if you're reviewing a whole month and it goes back to the top. Other than this, it's a great app."
2928,Fantastic app! It has the smart functions that I expect and love (scheduling/recurring transactions) and it is so simple to use. I was hesitant during the setup stage whether it would be worth it but by golly it is. goodbudget has worked it's way into my every day and I find myself 'waiting' for a transaction to process through my bank accounts so that I can update it into my app. I'll be renewing my subscription every year and doing away with my excel records.
2929,Very helpful app for keeping track of spending abd income. Pleasing to look at and easy to understand.
2930,Coming back to edit this. We have now paid for the subscription for 2 years. Love this app. Can't recommend it enough.
2931,The best budget app out there.
2932,"Great budget tool! My husband and I use the basic free version to track our spending, and it's so easy to use. East setup, easy logging of expenses, and great reports!"
2933,Sand send my good budget app to my home screen
2934,"I love this app! It is simple and provides the flexibility to budget the way I want. My spouse and I love that we can both see all expenses and we love having the app share how much we are ahead or behind. It makes budgeting anr saving feel like a game. I like not having it link to our accounts se we are responsible to enter all expenses. It keeps us accountable. Also, it provides the flexibility to budget the way we want rather than being tied to a budgeting program or method."
2935,Very 1_20_2021 Educationally
2936,"I'm new to envelope budgeting, but so far I like it very much. I find it much easier & useful compared to other budgeting methods. Thank you Goodbudget! :)"
2937,"Love the app lots and lots. I use the free version because $45 a year is a bit more than I am willing to pay for an app designed to help you be good with money. I wish it had an ""auto deduct"" feature. I have several bills that are automatically pulled from my banking account and sometimes forget to note it on the app. Absolutely no big bugs or complaints!! Update 2020; Upgraded to the paid version and it's worth the money to track all my bills and accounts easily. Love it!"
2938,"Been a subscriber for 3 yrs and LOVE it!!! Much better than my custom excel worksheet I was using, absolutely worth the fee for the plus version!! I like that it doesn't auto sync to bank accts. I wanted total control and manually entering everything makes me more aware/accountable of our spending. Easy to update budget/envelopes as things have changed over the yrs. After setting it all up, I now spend 5-10 minutes daily updating for transactions across all our accts, loans, credit cards, etc."
2939,I have been using this app since it was im beta testing and used to be called EEBA (Easy Envelope Budget Aid). I have never felt the need to look for another personal finance budgeting app. The best thing about this app is that it is dead simple to use while having all the customization options that you'll ever need.
2940,Very useful envelope budget. Very good.
2941,"I have now been using this app for 7 or 8 years (back when it was EEBA). I absolutely love it. My husband and I have it on our phones and can easily look and make wise decisions financially. We also have our own envelopes that we can spend money out of without talking to each other. That makes it nice when you just want to pick something up at the craft store. We literally saved over $30,000 and paid off our house in 7 years. Thanks!"
2942,Nice budget app!
2943,Excellent app. Easy to uses it!
2944,It's a good budget
2945,Great
2946,"If theres donate button, I think I go donate rather buy the plus version üòÖ"
2947,"The icon is so cute. i can have many envelopes, fill them up at start of the month, then monitor their usage, just like watching ur data usage. Thanks devs!!"
2948,This app has been incredibly helpful for my wife and I to stay on the same page with our budget. The only thing I wish it had was home screen widgets for individual budgets.
2949,I love this app. Makes setting up a budget so much easier & keeping track of your money easier too.
2950,"This app has made personal finance for the last 3 years a breeze. Highly recommend purchasing the premium, it's pointless using the free version."
2951,Nice app
2952,Honestly the best budget app that doesn't sync with your bank account. Was a bit of a struggle in the beginning but now that I've figured things out it's amazing. Having a we version that syncs with your account is also nice.
2953,I love the envelope system. It's intuitive to use.
2954,Have been using this app for years now and it is the best!
2955,Phenomenal app which employs an ingenious budgeting methodology. Really impressive!
2956,Love it
2957,I love how this app can help me track my real-lifr envelope budget system. I highly recommend this app to help you guys who want to do very doable budgeting system.
2958,Have tried too many apps before and found this one to be the most effective. Been using it for 5 years now and is still the best app I would recommend to manage your finances!
2959,Best budget app ever!
2960,So happy I found Goodbudget. I have tried many different solutions and none of them to work for me. This is perfect for what I need.
2961,"Best budgeting app I've used by far. Very quick to load data. Doesn't ask for all of my personal information. Doesn't allow all transaction types from the app (income, debt payments, envelope filling) which is a bummer, but I use them infrequently enough that I can use the desktop version. Much better experience than Mint overall."
2962,Great app to get budget in order
2963,I have high hopes for Goodbudget (GB) & me. I had EEBA but can't remember why I stopped using it (got distracted?). I have no desire to interview other budgeting apps. GB seems to be helping me in my 3rd week! Although I'm scratching my head that the widget isn't in the widget tab of my Galaxy S2. ..... UPDATE 8/11g14: I have the widget! Moving the app from the SD card to the phone solved that! (Thx Steve! ) Dark theme is great! Easy on eyes. Green stands out.
2964,"I LOVE this app and I love that it doesn't insist on syncing with my bank account. When I write a check, I can take the money right out of my ""envelope"" without waiting for the recipient to deposit it. Likewise, when I take out cash at the ATM, I don't have to take the money out of my ""envelope"" on the app until I actually spend it! Some might call it low-tech but I think it's a miracle"
2965,"Excellent app for 'envelope type' home budgeting. It does require a bit of learning in the beginning, but it pays off, believe me. I only wish I could protect it with a PIN or something. I love the fact that I can use Web interface for larger use cases (editing accounts, envelopes etc.), and use my phone to enter everyday transactions."
2966,EDIT: See below for original. I emailed and they helped me with my problem straight away. Thanks so much! Started off well but payments into my budget keep getting stuck on pending (wth even is pending??? Serves no purpose in my use!?) And this time has been stuck on it for nearly two weeks. Pretty much given up on it as this makes it useless. Would love this to be fixed and will change my review if so. Thanks.
2967,This app has helped my husband and I to grasp our finances. The 'shared' application is really great because it allows us to update expenses separately but still both see our joint budget. I would recommend this app to anyone who needs help sticking to a budget.
2968,I've tried several budgeting apps and this is by far the best! I love the concept of virtual envelopes! The ability to split one transaction into multiple envelopes is such a time saver - it even calculates it for me! Love this app!!
2969,Great app that uses the envelope budgeting method. So much for rent or mortgage so much for groceries so much for utilities and etc... Helped me buy a house and a car. Very useful. Plus if you want to know if you paid a bill just look at what you put on your transactions history of not they're assume you didn't pay it if it never showed up in the bank. Useful for helping you learn where your big expenses are that are less obvious on a day to day basis (here's looking at your Starbucks habit)...
2970,Excellent app
2971,Great app and works as expected. I would love to see multi currency support though.
2972,"So far, so good! Worlds better than Mint. I've noticed that many of the negative reviews have a common theme - if you're not already familiar with the envelope system, like used by Dave Ramsay/Financial Peace, please watch the helpful tutorial videos for this app. It will make all the difference!"
2973,"What a great budget app!! Once you get the hang of it and learn how to use it, it helps out so much!!!!! Love it!"
2974,simple and useful
2975,great app to use to know where you are at with your budget while on the go.
2976,"Absolutely love it!! Much better than MINT. Simple but powerful app to track finances. You have to enter transactions manually, but setting up the budget is easy and I love the ""envelope transfer"" feature. Just because ""going out"" budget is empty doesn't mean you can't go, the money just has to come from another category. Great app."
2977,"Good, useful app but I think its time for an overhaul. I think it needs a new look and added features, or make them clearer at least, such as splitting transactions between envelopes or moving money among envelopes. Again, good functional app but needs a bit of an update"
2978,helpful app for budgeting
2979,We have been using Goodbudget for several years and it has been a game changer. We close on our first house in a few weeks and are almost out of debt except for our mortgage! Thank you!
2980,I love this app....I can keep track of almost everything and I kinda know where I stand
2981,exactly what I wanted
2982,Wonderful and convenient app. Keep budgeting and expense track in one. I like it. Rejoice for your great idea.
2983,Excellent budgeting app for cross-platform use. both my iPhone-using wife and my Android-using self can finally find a way to keep out budgets in sync without a snag. Free to use and most basic functions are available in the free version. Must have if your trying to use the envelope system (either hypothetically or physically). Keep up the good work guys!
2984,This is everything that Im looking for. Thank you üíï
2985,"I love this app, you get so much for it being free! I just have a question, I get paid fortnightly (death of all maths budgets) what is the best way to load monthly expenses on a fortnightly budget? I've tried using goals and I've tried dividing the difference into two forrnights but it never works out, please help? (I prefer a fortnightly budget over a monthly budget)"
2986,"Been using this for 5+ years. It's an uncomplicated way to track our ""shopping"" for groceries, gas, kids commission, & fun money. I also have Mint but use Goodbudget to keep our ""shopping"" in check."
2987,Finally have savings and know where my money is going!
2988,I'm very impressed. I used to be worried and wouldn't let myself spend anything because I didn't know what I had and how much I needed to save. But now I know exactly how much I have to spend and it is very freeing. I would definitely recommend giving this a try!
2989,Essential. it's great to have a mobile and desktop application
2990,"I've been using Goodbudget for several years now, and it's been so helpful for keeping track of my money. I've been able to notice trends in unnecessary spending to cut back and save for things like vacation and fun, and to give toward causes I support. I love how goal envelopes help me save for long-term expenses. And with scheduled transactions, Goodbudget takes care of my regular payments and fills so I don't have to. The plus subscription is worth it to have unlimited accounts and envelopes!"
2991,"Updating my review... Again, I've used this app for about 4 years and I find this to be the BEST for managing my money. Easy to use, and easy to manage money, 6 stars"
2992,"Best app for the job for me, and I tried a bunch. This was the one that matched best my budget style. Can only say it would be nice to have another theme or two to use, rather than just white/green. Dark theme is too extreme and hurts my eyes."
2993,great overview
2994,Very nice! dark theme üëè
2995,budgeting reflects our priority
2996,"This is the most practical and useful budget tracker app. in one word, its Awesome."
2997,Great product. I've used it for years
2998,Excellent app. Very intuitive and effective. Most of the famous one tend to be overly complicated. This one does expense tracking very well.
2999,We always come back to this app for budgeting.
3000,great app among all the ones i have tried... love it... my wife and I shared the access so we know where we are at all times
3001,I love this app. We use it with my wife to stay within our budget constraints.
3002,excellent budget and one planning app
3003,"update: Online setup is much easier. Just getting started, but so far so good."
3004,Easy to learn and very useful. Makes it easy to monitor spending and save up money.
3005,"Best App for My Family I had used Goodbudget for a few years, and quit using it to try other budget apps. I tried at least 10 different apps and nothing compares to this one. Most of the other apps were hard to figure out and didn't allow split transactions. I'm glad to be back to a very user friendly atmosphere."
3006,very nice
3007,"I've been using the paid version for a short while now. I am transitioning from Quicken 2017. Quicken has been bloated and buggy for some time now. I finally couldn't take it when the Quicken sync began only working in one direction causing me to constantly track down register errors. Goodbudget seems to work great and is straight forward both on the PC and mobile. In short, it works great! I've been using GB for a few months now and couldn't be more pleased. *update Jan '19* Still great!"
3008,easy and simple and does the job.
3009,Super useful
3010,"Easy to use. 10 envelopes are not enough. but, u can expand for a cost..."
3011,[01.2019] On my third year of using.. still useful as before! ------------------ Been using it for a year now.. still one of my most used apps in my phone. Keep it up!
3012,Mantap lah buat ngurus budget.
3013,Love this app. I've been using it since 2016 to monitor and manage our household budget.
3014,"Ideal budgeting app. I don't want complications, and connection to a bank account, or help with setting up a budget. I need a simple way to keep track of monthly spending with my spouse. This App is absolutely perfect. Kudos."
3015,..but I got there eventually and works for what we need. I told all my friends about it. I especially get excited looking at our goals andhow much money is in or knowing for certain when one debt will be fully paid. I love that my husband and I can both access the app and see how much is available to spend where
3016,Great improvements with this version!
3017,"Excellent for straight forward budgeting. Using it to help my 11 year old learn to manage money. Am glad it does not require linkage to a bank account, as he is not ready for that yet."
3018,"Fantastic. Very helpful way to budget/monitor finances. Definitely worth all the time it takes to set up and hone your budget. Note: Quite a minor thing, and may be just because of the old phone I'm using, but it's annoying that every time the app updates i lose my widget."
3019,"We have been using this app for about 3 years. It's wonderful. It takes some getting used to and figuring out how to get it all set up, but once you do it's a breeze to use."
3020,Loved it! Tried a lot of budgeting app but this is the only one that works with my budgeting style. I love that it's very much like a cash envelope system so it's easy for me to reconcile and see if I'm over my set budget.
3021,This is a lifesaver. I've used a few budgeting apps. This one keeps evrty th ing simple and at a glance I can see everything I need. I can even plan year long goals. Christmas had a plan emergencies have a plan. Gold.
3022,"Best budget app I have ever used. A recent update added multiscreen support. A++!!! It was a major needed feature I and others requested on there support forms. They really do listen to there customs! Now if I could custom a from to a to day on the report in the app like i can on the webpage, this app would be perfect."
3023,very useful.
3024,"This is exactly what I needed. My pay fluctuates and I like to see what I will have inbetween paychecks. I didn't need anything that shows what I am spending my money on. I used Spendee for about a year before they upgraded and I liked their app. However, it is very buggy and doesn't update my balances so I changed. The balance update feature is great too! I have no desire to put every receipt or transaction so it's nice to just update my balance every few days and see where I'm at."
3025,"Love the app. It's so helpful to be able to plan out my finances far in advance. The new update does have some glitches. Most annoyingly, I happily paid for a pro account but my husband is not able to get access on his phone. I do have faith that future updates will fix any issues, so overall it's money well spent regardless."
3026,I started with the free version and switched to the paid version about 5 months later. It's worth it.
3027,This is the best budget planning calendar!
3028,"This app is exactly what I have been trying to replace when my previous Bank stopped access to their financial budgeting app. All I wanted was a running total of my checking account complimented by fixed payments so I can predict any need to add money. Very simple to use, fits my needs and I hope it fits others needs as well."
3029,"It was good until they updated it; now it freezes and won't update transactions properly. Time for a new app, I guess. edit: They did indeed fix the issue. Now that it is fixed, this app is worthy of 5 stars. It is a great financial tracking app but the part I love the most is the running balance that it has which many others do not have. This is why I use this particular app."
3030,"This app is a great way to get ahold of your finances. Set up your recurring credits and debits to your account, and schedule any anticipated payments you know about. You'll be able to accurately predict what your account will look like at any given future date. I personally use it to schedule credit card payments, so that I can meet utilization goals in 2020. As a tip, try setting a daily ""allowance"" transaction for things like food, that way you can factor that estimate into your budget. A+"
3031,I love this app. I can be as detailed as I want. I can see where I'll be financially further down the road. I don't like manually tracking every expense so I just update the balance manually every day based on my account balance. Being able to add a bill and just set it to repeat monthly forever is so great. You can also view it in browser.
3032,"I absolutely love this app. I've tried other finance apps like Mint, but this is by far better in my opinion. I really enjoy how you can do so many customizations to accounts. I've been logging my transactions in this for over a year and a half now."
3033,I really like how easy it was to set up my budget and know in real time how much money I have on hand. I had an issue with the app so I emailed them and had a response right away from an actual person. They worked with me until the issue was resolved. Fantastic app!
3034,"Awesome. For me there is no better way to budget than using a calendar. The fact that it is also available online via a computer, makes this a must have. Sure, the app is missing a few bells and whistles, but it does what it is meant to do! I can finally step away from my Excel budget!"
3035,"Love It! Very easy to use. Simple. Has back up, email statements and you can take pictures of receipts. Also keeps track of future transactions in a calendar. I'm happy with it."
3036,UPDATE: The app is indeed fully functional again and no longer glitchy! This has been my favorite budgeting app for many months now after trying out at least 7 of the top rated ones. I loved this app for its simplicity and smooth and clever calendar UI.
3037,"I like it. Easy app to see how much money I'll have by the end of the month, and keeps me on track."
3038,"Doesn't bother you for details, no notifications, no ads, simple and clean interface. Almost too good to be true, it's rare to see an app that does exactly what I want it to do."
3039,Works perfect. Calendar app for finances that lets you see all you incoming and outgoing expenses for any given day/week. Allows you to budget and see what future savings will look like if you stick to it.
3040,Just what I need. Easy and simple yet many useful features.
3041,"This has helped me so much in keeping things organized with my bills. As long as you keep up with the app, you can easily keep a good record and stay aware of future weeks."
3042,I wouldn't use another app to track everything. made simple and easy and so far it's been a great experience even using the free version.
3043,"It works as it is supposed to, but make sure to still check your accounts in case you forget to add something. It's been very helpful."
3044,I've been using this app for over a year now and it's been absolutely essential. I don't know what I'd do without it. I like that it doesn't have to sync with my bank account; that feels unsafe to me.
3045,I have been using this app since 2015. Such an awesome and tremendously useful app. Every feature is absolutely easy and convinient to use
3046,I love this app. so simple and useful.
3047,Excellent forcast calendar.
3048,Just what I needed! üí™üèª
3049,love this app
3050,"I just started using this app after searching online for best rated budget apps of 2018, Dollar bird was on the list. So far I love it,  easy to navigate, overall visual of your spending with a calendar stating how much money you have in each day of the month. I also like the option of setting up recurring payments, color coordination, and daily reminders to add your expenses to the app.  Great for visual learners in my opinion! No problems yet with the app so will give it a 5 üåü rating."
3051,It works perfectly for what I want. It's very easy to track expenses and categorize things. I like the Simplicity of it. It doesn't try too hard to do a bunch of stuff I don't need.
3052,"Love this app!!! Has made keeping track of my spending so much easier, and with a very visually pleasing UI.  One request: You guys should push out an iPad version of the app!!"
3053,This is the most flexible and useful way to see the instantaneous effects of your budgeting at any point in time.
3054,"Does exactly what it says it does and does it well. Makes me more 
accountable for my finances over an automated system. Really wish it had a 
dark background setting. Would recommend to a friend."
3055,Calendar based budgeting seems to work best for me this app works great and very easy. Looking forward to Future feature updates
3056,Very easy to use.  Love the simplicity of it.  Don't change anything.  And keep it free for personal users please.
3057,"Its brilliant! The interface is refreshing. No frills, easy to use, to the 
point!"
3058,Very clean interface.  Great month view budget
3059,Love it!
3060,I started with the free version and switched to the paid version about 5 months later. It's worth it.
3061,"I have tried a couple of finance tracking applications and Dollarbird is the best one. The user interface is very intuitive and I love the fact that categories are customizable. Dollarbird is exactly what I needed - it's just perfect. Thank you so much! Edit: switching to paid only with the cheapest subscription being $3.33 / month is an insult to all your users. I wouldn't be using this app if I could afford paying for it. Edit 2: Alright, I'm convinced. I've subscribed."
3062,"Love the app. It's so helpful to be able to plan out my finances far in advance. The new update does have some glitches. Most annoyingly, I happily paid for a pro account but my husband is not able to get access on his phone. I do have faith that future updates will fix any issues, so overall it's money well spent regardless."
3063,Excellent app for tracking your spending. It has really helped me budget my money better to start saving instead of wasting it. Having multiple calanders to have seperate accounts is a great way to track savings.
3064,"This is exactly what I needed. My pay fluctuates and I like to see what I will have inbetween paychecks. I didn't need anything that shows what I am spending my money on.

3069,"Very good app with great, easy and friendly UI. It works flawless on offline mode!Everyday reminder is back. I miss a dark theme UI but in general is gorgeous. Bravo!"
3070,Very easy to use
3071,Love it
3072,I have been using this app since 2015. Such an awesome and tremendously useful app. Every feature is absolutely easy and convinient to use
3073,"Great, simple finance management app. The calendar view is ideal as it allows me to see what days I have payments and how much money I have left at the end of each month."
3074,Great app. Using it for the last 3 years. Loved it. Absolutely great concept. The expense calendar.
3075,"Awesome. For me there is no better way to budget than using a calendar. The fact that it is also available online via a computer, makes this a must have. Sure, the app is missing a few bells and whistles, but it does what it is meant to do! I can finally step away from my Excel budget!"
3076,Love it!
3077,"The concept and execution of this app is brilliant. As someone who moved out for the first time it gives me insights not only on my budget, but also the savings I can have days, weeks, months into the future if I'm careful with my spending. Extremely simple and minimalistic but accomplishes a lot - it also does the basics really well. Despite the name, no currency here so anyone from any country can use it comfortably. Requests: Dark Mode theme, Widgets (even just 1 quick add expenses/income)."
3078,"Really intuitive, simple, easy to use, clear. I like it."
3079,"This has helped me so much in keeping things organized with my bills. As long as you keep up with the app, you can easily keep a good record and stay aware of future weeks."
3080,How is there an app like this giving solutions to problems even before we have them??? Super!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3086,Looove this app

You'll be able to accurately predict what your account will look like at any given future date. I personally use it to schedule credit card payments, so that I can meet utilization goals in 2020. As a tip, try setting a daily ""allowance"" transaction for things like food, that way you can factor that estimate into your budget. A+"
3088,"I absolutely love this app. I've tried other finance apps like Mint, but this is by far better in my opinion. I really enjoy how you can do so many customizations to accounts. I've been logging my transactions in this for over a year and a half now."
3089,Best app to track spending but you have to be discipline
3090,"Love It! Very easy to use. Simple. Has back up, email statements and you can take pictures of receipts. Also keeps track of future transactions in a calendar. I'm happy with it."
3091,I love this app. I can be as detailed as I want. I can see where I'll be financially further down the road. I don't like manually tracking every expense so I just update the balance manually every day based on my account balance. Being able to add a bill and just set it to repeat monthly forever is so great. You can also view it in browser.
3092,"Love this app - the calendar method is by far the best. However, a feature request: I need the app to be able to view multiple calendars at once (like the web app can). Until then, I'll be using the desktop version. oh, and a request for both platforms: add an ability to run a date search based on account balance range (i.e. show me all days in thr next 3 months that my forcasted balance is less than or equal to $100). keep up the great work, team!"
3093,Serve the purpose
3094,I love this app. so simple and useful.
3095,Nice and useful app. Good job.
3096,"I just can't get this app to work well. I loved the classic dollarbird, but this new version just doesn't work. It works, but not reliably. And I can't use it then. I don't want to track my expenses and have them disappear or appear twice, especially not when it's 2am and I'm not in the best shape to be thinking of that. :) Please just make sure your app works offline. Then, every once in a while, sync. How often people use this app on more than one device? 1. When they change their phone 2. Sometimes through the website (I don't even know how the website looks like. Never used it) I think I'll just go back to dollarbird classic. I need stability more than cloud. Please fix you app. Other things that don't work: things randomly change order. How hard is it to just sort things? Even alphabetically would do. Things disappear when you add/remove other things on the same day. You need to wait for the sync. I hate waiting. And phones are not meant to always have super fast internet."
3097,The best and easiest way to handle my finances
3098,very useful app
3099,Wow! finally found the app that i need. Now can you add dark theme for the calendar? That would be great
3100,"Doesn't bother you for details, no notifications, no ads, simple and clean interface. Almost too good to be true, it's rare to see an app that does exactly what I want it to do."
3101,"cea mai comodƒÉ aplicatie pentru finanate, 5 stele"
3102,Awesome !
3103,"This is an awesome application to keep track of financial records, user friendly and responsive."
3104,best Apps
3105,"My favorite money management app, since time then i usde iPhone. It's called DB Classic"
3106,"Simple is best, this app is great at just showing you an overview of what you have coming in and going out across the month. The calendar view is by far the best way to manage finances I feel. The only improvements I would suggest would be synchronisation between your phone's calendar and the apps and I wish transfers between the in app calendars would sync properly."
3107,"It's very easy to use, other apps just look like a spreadsheet I could draw at home and do my own maths."
3108,UPDATE: The app is indeed fully functional again and no longer glitchy! This has been my favorite budgeting app for many months now after trying out at least 7 of the top rated ones. I loved this app for its simplicity and smooth and clever calendar UI.
3109,"It was good until they updated it; now it freezes and won't update transactions properly. Time for a new app, I guess. edit: They did indeed fix the issue. Now that it is fixed, this app is worthy of 5 stars. It is a great financial tracking app but the part I love the most is the running balance that it has which many others do not have. This is why I use this particular app."
3110,love this app
3111,I wouldn't use another app to track everything. made simple and easy and so far it's been a great experience even using the free version.
3112,I really like how easy it was to set up my budget and know in real time how much money I have on hand. I had an issue with the app so I emailed them and had a response right away from an actual person. They worked with me until the issue was resolved. Fantastic app!
3113,I've been using this app for over a year now and it's been absolutely essential. I don't know what I'd do without it. I like that it doesn't have to sync with my bank account; that feels unsafe to me.
3114,This is the best personal finance app I've come across till date. Kudos to the team.
3115,Very helpful in managing my expenses
3116,Amazing ! From the day I installed i can know the money inflow and outflow ... Helps making expense for productive stuffs ! Loving it
3117,Not a bad app for couples sharing finances
3118,"I love the app and the calendar view. The web version has more detailed 
graphics for visualizing your cash flow. This app is perfect if you want to 
take control of your money."
3119,"Its brilliant! The interface is refreshing. No frills, easy to use, to the 
point!"
3120,"Hello fellas, I love your app specially because of the calendar. The only thing I miss is a widget to check it faster. If by any chance you decide to add a simple widget showing the calendar and the plus symbol to add an expense (similar to the calendar widget of Android with the plus symbol t schedule new tasks), I would be really happy."
3121,"Does exactly what it says it does and does it well. Makes me more 
accountable for my finances over an automated system. Really wish it had a 
dark background setting. Would recommend to a friend."
3122,Fantastic app...heard of it on Citi FM in Ghana and decided to try.
3123,Brilliant !!! what did I just found! Looks brilliant!
3124,"Is the app having trouble right now? I love dollarbird and i use it daily. 
Problem is it wont show me the mothlty totals for the expense and income"
3125,Like stumbling upon a diamond in the dirt. Worth it
3126,Super
3127,"Love it. A fantastic simple to use app to track finances and future 
projections. The low score surprised me as it is much more than I expected, 
and is exactly what I didn't know I needed!"
3128,Smart.
3129,Calendar based budgeting seems to work best for me this app works great and very easy. Looking forward to Future feature updates
3130,Exactly what i was looking for to easily keep track of my accounts. Allows items to be repeated which is handy so i don't have to enter them manually each month. The end of day reminder is a nice touch so i can remember to keep the calendar up to date.
3131,"Love this app!!! Has made keeping track of my spending so much easier, and with a very visually pleasing UI.  One request: You guys should push out an iPad version of the app!!"
3132,"I would like to thank this app for saving my 100$. Because this app, i can detect a mistake in a purchase being done."
3133,Very easy to use.  Love the simplicity of it.  Don't change anything.  And keep it free for personal users please.
3134,So far so great!
3135,"I just started using this app after searching online for best rated budget apps of 2018, Dollar bird was on the list. So far I love it,  easy to navigate, overall visual of your spending with a calendar stating how much money you have in each day of the month. I also like the option of setting up recurring payments, color coordination, and daily reminders to add your expenses to the app.  Great for visual learners in my opinion! No problems yet with the app so will give it a 5 üåü rating."
3136,It is a great app for checking my finances
3137,This is the most flexible and useful way to see the instantaneous effects of your budgeting at any point in time.
3138,"Best finance app out there. Sure, there's a lot to get better but this is the way I want to track my expenses."
3139,It works perfectly for what I want. It's very easy to track expenses and categorize things. I like the Simplicity of it. It doesn't try too hard to do a bunch of stuff I don't need.
3140,"DollarBird really gets my needs. I have tried SO MANY budget apps. No other has provided such a clear overview. I wanted to add what my reoccurring bills were and my salary and get a clear answer as to how much I would have left over to put into savings / pay off debt at the end of the moth. Thank you DollarBird, I can finally stop my search üòâ‚ô•Ô∏è"
3141,Perfect
3142,Very good app to manage and having track of  personal expenses and investment....A good habit and everyone must have it..... I must say it's very user friendly with cloud facility.....thumbs up üëçüëçüëç
3143,"I don't understand all the negative reviews, the app is great. It could load stuff a bit faster but you are paying 0$ for 99% of the content so it's not a big deal."
3144,"Been using the classic version for awhile and finally got around to migrating. I'm glad it's still in calendar format and it looks pretty great so far! Some people have commented that it takes more clicks or something to update transactions but I don't feel any different. I think it still serves the function just fine- I like how the label predicts based on past transactions, that's helpful. I'm also extremely grateful that we can change the week to start from Sunday. Thank you very much and all the best to the team for the new updates and everything! Quick question- I can uninstall DB classic now that I've completed the migration right? Edit- Thank you for the response! And alright, I'll do that!"
3145,Very clean interface.  Great month view budget
3146,Very useful app. Simple and easy to use. Five stars !!!
3147,"The one and only personal finance tracker that works for me. I guess it's because of the calendar interface. Simple, neat UX, love the web app too."
3148,Best app for budget management.
3149,Love the app! Really like the fact that you are not forcing us to get used to a completely new experience but instead of that you displace an existing experience everyone is familiar with (creating a calendar entry)
3150,"Tried a lot of personal finance managers, and this one is the only one with a system that makes sense to me."
3151,Easy to use
3152,Love it!
3153,Hands down the best personal finance app I have ever used. üëç
3154,Wow! The autocategorization is awesome!
3155,Best personal finance app ever!
3156,"Not without its quirks and frustrations, but as far as I know it's one of the only envelope budgeting apps that automatically syncs your bank transactions (YNAB is the other). I've used it for many, many years and find it indispensable to managing our finances using the envelope budgeting method."
3157,"May 2021: I wanted to update and say that over the last year Mvelopes has worked phenomenally. I highly recommend this app for those who follow Dave Ramsey, but can manage a credit card and only use credit for based on what is in the bank. This allows the best of both worlds: sticking to a budget and never actually adding any new debt, but at the same time getting credit card rewards. I highly recommend this for anyone following Mr. Money Mustache, The Money Guy Show, FIRE, etc., so you can have a tight budget and stick to it. May 2020: Working great now that a few bugs were ironed out. Love Desktop access on the PC as well."
3158,"This app has completely changed my outlook on money and finances. I'm not scared to look at my bank account anymore, nor do I worry about spending money. I know exactly what my money is doing and where it is. Love this amazing app."
3159,"After adding my bank account, transactions got downloaded which inassign to envelope. This seems to be so easy on the envelope I can budget my expenses and actual funds with deposit transactions. Nice App!!!"
3160,This is exactly what I needed to get control of my finances. It takes a bit of time to get started but it is well worth it.
3161,Excellent budgeting app I was looking for. Can manage all expenses at one place. Good app to track expenses.
3162,Really awesome and amazing app. I able to track all my financial activities and able to save my hard earned money.
3163,Best app for budgeting. Easy to use budget managing app.
3164,One of the best budget apps I have ever used. Helped me to gain control over the flow of money. By using this app I realized how much money I was spending as unnecessary expenses. It took me sometime to get used to it but it was worth the time spend. I decided to upgrade to plus version to get full advantage of the app.. thank you mvelopes.
3165,"Nice interface, easy to use the app !!"
3166,"I love mvelopes on my laptop and this app just adds more convenience. I'm aMvelopes user for 10 years. Life changing. Mv5 (current version) is now fabulous. The old version (mv4) was slow so I tried four other money mgt programs and always missed features or layout options that mvelopes had. Now we have Mv5 which is super... it's simplicity and features blew ynab, everydollar, quicken and banktivity out of the water when actually using each. Well done mvelopes. So easy."
3167,Supper app for budgeting daily expenses !
3168,"A big app which has plenty on features, Initially it takes some time to find out what to do (Which happens to many apps but here ""help"" section does provide path to learn) If used precisely budget and funding goes better and better, Great app this :)"
3169,"Great app for budget, Help to save money with construction of spending and funding plan. Has offline account feature so even when issue with bank connection this account easily help import all transaction with QFX, They are missing few features from MV4 but soon they will be on app I believe!!!"
3170,I am using this app from past few months and started loving it. Initially they charge for subscription but worth to pay as I am able to download my bank transaction with connecting my FI from the app. Easy to cancel from App store whenever required.
3171,"Love the Mvelopes app, cool old school envelope budgeting system. Bank connectivity, Funding Plan, Reports and much more features inside the app. Worth a try!!"
3172,Seamless connection with bank. No issues assigning the transactions. It helps calculating account balances and then budget. Tremendous app.
3173,"Great tool... I'm using it for a month now, efficient way to track money expenses and save using planning features."
3174,One of the great budgeting application and very user friendly!
3175,"Looks awesome to me. After migration to mv5, it's a great experience."
3176,Best budgeting app. Does a great job of keeping us on track.
3177,Mvelopes is really a useful application it helped me a lot for managing all my finances.
3178,Been using Mvelopes for a year. It's the best system for managing our money. Recommended to all
3179,"""Best app used so far for budget!!"""
3180,"My family has been using Mvelopes for decades. So, this budgeting tool is our lifeline in tracking expenses. Despite a constant change in technology from the Bank side, Mvelopes is always quick to adjust and establish the communication with Bank back. Also, I love the Manual importing transactions feature which allows us to be on the top of our Budgeting even if our Bank is making hard to communicate. So, yes, Mvelopes is an integral part of lifestyle now!!!!"
3181,"App that support finance and account and help and guide user to pay down their debts, Helpful overall !!!"
3182,One of the finest tool I am using to track my expenses.
3183,Excillent budgeting App!!
3184,Nice product to manage budget.
3185,"Best app I have ever used, Simple UI fast transaction assignment, planning budget with Income addition are very useful. Will suggest to use it worth a try."
3186,Great app. Budgeting becomes very easy with mvelopes. It's user friendly too !!
3187,"I wish I would have tried this app years ago! I have been using the free envelope apps. They are ok but it was easy to forget to add something, plus I had problems altering my budget. This automatically tells me when money is deducted from my account :) no possibility of forgetting. It is also linked to my credit card so it's easier to monitor my progress in getting it paid off :)"
3188,"This app is the best of both worlds between envelope budgeting and linked accounts. It took me a little time to figure out how to manage the debt accounts and corresponding envelopes. The small modest fee each month is worth it, for it saves me quite a bit of time compared to how I used to budget. The budget planning feature is a time saver as well and fairly intuitive to setup. I have read some of the negative reviews but it is working almost flawlessly for me."
3189,"Fantastic budgeting app, It lets user to connect with their FI / Banks and let us budget, plan and track spending."
3190,Very good app !!
3191,"I've been an envelopes user for many years now, and I love the way it helps me not only budget for the present but also plan for the future."
3192,"I have been using this app for several years, and it makes keeping track of my accounts and transactions so simple. If you are looking for a way to apply the principles of Financial Peace University in a digital way or just want to make sure you are sticking to your monthly budget, this app is a great tool. Please be aware that a subscription is required, but the fee is reasonable."
3193,"I had the goal to improve my family budget. This app has helped me immensely because of its simplicity and overall user experience. I recommend it to anyone looking to improve or succeed with their budgeting needs, no matter what they are."
3194,"Love the app. It gets transactions from your online accounts. Also, UI is cool and user-friendly. Life saver for me and my family in terms it helps to control the budget."
3195,This app has changed my life. I have tried other budgeting applications but never with the same amount of success that Mvelopes has given me. Calls with Mvelopes always goes smoothly and the people are so helpful. I would recommend this budgeting app to anyone.
3196,"I've been envelope budgeting for years, when I found Mvelopes I was a bit skeptical trying to manage my funds online, but I have found Mvelopes to be one of the most helpful apps I've ever used. I've reached and surpassed many of my financial goals by using Mvelopes. It's easy and gives me control and confidence over my finances."
3197,"Great program, but they seem to be having a challenge with the rollout of the new website and syncing with the app. Update: looked at another response and sideloaded the app and it now seems to be working."
3198,"a literal lifesaver! Over the last 8 years I have been able to make an actual savings and wealth while paying off all of my debt thanks to this system. It takes a moment to get used to, but at 25 being debt free and about to buy a house is a win!"
3199,I reviewed several different budgeting apps and this one was by far the best. This app does exactly what I used to do in Excel but it is all automatic and saves me so much time.
3200,I appreciate being able to quickly I can allocate my income and assign my expenditures a budget category. It is always a challenge to learn a new program but this one is worth it.
3201,"Finally a budget app that works for me. Entries take just a few seconds, and I know immediately how I'm doing."
3202,Excellent customer service with live chats and electronic support!!! Roderick has helped me a couple times and is phenomenal.
3203,"Best Budgeting app, Easy to use so works for me."
3204,There are still some bugs to be worked out but so far my experience with customer service and help maximizing use of the app has been excellent.
3205,"Very impressed! Their direct connection to CapitalOne has been particularly helpful, and I love the new UI they just rolled out."
3206,The notifications about new transactions to reconcile is so convenient. It helps me stay on top of my budget every day.
3207,"I have been using Mvelopes for years and appreciate the staff that is always nice, friendly, and even answers my dumbest of questions with respect and professionalism. I really enjoyed the one on one coaching as well. Made a big difference for me on my journey."
3208,Love it! We went from using Goodbudget along with Moneydance but have replaced both with this. How did we ever manage our finances without Mvelopes?
3209,Nothing can budget money quite the way that mvelopes does!
3210,Very helpful in using a cash envelopes system BUT digitally and without the hassle of withdrawing cash each week and carrying it around.
3211,This app has worked well for my family to keep us on budget and see where we need to make cuts to gain savings.
3212,The best thing since sliced bread. Great for financial planning and achieving/living a debt free lifestyle.
3213,"Love it, helped me get into a habit of checking my finances every day with ease!"
3214,This app is awesome. Helps us know exactly how our money is being spent and stay on budget.
3215,I love that I can connect my capital one and usaa accounts directly. So many apps struggle with these banks.
3216,Using mvelopes system has changed my life. It has allowed me pay off some debts that I have been struggling with. I also have money for travel when cova let's up.
3217,I love being able to look at my budget at a glance in my phone! It's very helpful.
3218,love this app! it helps keep our budget in line.

3249,Nice app
3250,It's looking cool as UI and it's helping a lot to grow financially.
3251,I have been using Mvelopes for more than 10 years. The budgeting helped us pay off our house in six years and become totally debt free. It has enabled us to plan for an early retirement. Before using Mvelopes our finances were very difficult to track and we had no idea where our money was going. Now it only takes a few minutes each week to move spending into the budget envelopes and i can see instantly where we stand with each spending category.
3252,"I have been using Mvelopes for 4 years now. By budgeting my money with Mvelopes, I have been able to save for school, a wedding, vacations, and medical expenses without having to take out a loan! Mvelopes has empowered me to control my money rather than letting it control me. I highly recommend it!"
3253,Easier and faster to use than the website for categorizing transactions.
3254,Mvelopes is a great tool to budget and track expenses.
3255,The best!

Now we have Mv5 which is super... it's simplicity and features blew ynab, everydollar, quicken and banktivity out of the water when actually using each. Well done mvelopes. So easy."
3295,Best budgeting app. Does a great job of keeping us on track.
3296,Nothing can budget money quite the way that mvelopes does!
3297,"I've been an envelopes user for many years now, and I love the way it helps me not only budget for the present but also plan for the future."
3298,Best in Market !!!!
3299,"Fantastic budgeting app, It lets user to connect with their FI / Banks and let us budget, plan and track spending."
3300,It's looking cool as UI and it's helping a lot to grow financially.
3301,"Love the app. It gets transactions from your online accounts. Also, UI is cool and user-friendly. Life saver for me and my family in terms it helps to control the budget."
3302,I appreciate being able to quickly I can allocate my income and assign my expenditures a budget category. It is always a challenge to learn a new program but this one is worth it.
3303,Excellent expense and budget tracking tool!
3304,Easier and faster to use than the website for categorizing transactions.
3305,I have been using Mvelopes for more than 10 years. The budgeting helped us pay off our house in six years and become totally debt free. It has enabled us to plan for an early retirement. Before using Mvelopes our finances were very difficult to track and we had no idea where our money was going. Now it only takes a few minutes each week to move spending into the budget envelopes and i can see instantly where we stand with each spending category.
3306,"I had the goal to improve my family budget. This app has helped me immensely because of its simplicity and overall user experience. I recommend it to anyone looking to improve or succeed with their budgeting needs, no matter what they are."
3307,"I have been using Mvelopes for 4 years now. By budgeting my money with Mvelopes, I have been able to save for school, a wedding, vacations, and medical expenses without having to take out a loan! Mvelopes has empowered me to control my money rather than letting it control me. I highly recommend it!"
3308,It just works. It makes it so much easier to stick to a budget
3309,"I've been envelope budgeting for years, when I found Mvelopes I was a bit skeptical trying to manage my funds online, but I have found Mvelopes to be one of the most helpful apps I've ever used. I've reached and surpassed many of my financial goals by using Mvelopes. It's easy and gives me control and confidence over my finances."
3310,"Very impressed! Their direct connection to CapitalOne has been particularly helpful, and I love the new UI they just rolled out."
3311,I love that I can connect my capital one and usaa accounts directly. So many apps struggle with these banks.
3312,Mvelopes is a great way to budget and manage my finances.
3313,"This app is the best of both worlds between envelope budgeting and linked accounts. It took me a little time to figure out how to manage the debt accounts and corresponding envelopes. The small modest fee each month is worth it, for it saves me quite a bit of time compared to how I used to budget. The budget planning feature is a time saver as well and fairly intuitive to setup. I have read some of the negative reviews but it is working almost flawlessly for me."
3314,Using mvelopes system has changed my life. It has allowed me pay off some debts that I have been struggling with. I also have money for travel when cova let's up.
3315,Intuitive and effective.
3316,The best!
3317,Mvelopes is a great tool to budget and track expenses.
3318,Good stuff
3319,Love the new features!
3320,Mvelopes is a great budget app
3321,Great budgeting app
3322,"Finally migrated to mvelopes 5 April 1, 2020. No issues with migrating and everything working great now! Love this app and budget system!"
3323,"Been using for over 10 years... My go to app... Has made budgeting and monthly bills a breeze, highly recommended! A bit of a learning curve. But once you have it down you won't regret it."
3324,Excellent tool for budgeting!
3325,Excellent customer service with live chats and electronic support!!! Roderick has helped me a couple times and is phenomenal.
3326,Has helped tremendously to keep my family on budget. Both android & PC platforms are user-friendly.
3327,Love it! We went from using Goodbudget along with Moneydance but have replaced both with this. How did we ever manage our finances without Mvelopes?
3328,"Have used mvelopes for years now. It's an essential tool in the management of my personal finances. And with version 5, the interface and speed are even better. ."
3329,There are still some bugs to be worked out but so far my experience with customer service and help maximizing use of the app has been excellent.
3330,This app has changed my life. I have tried other budgeting applications but never with the same amount of success that Mvelopes has given me. Calls with Mvelopes always goes smoothly and the people are so helpful. I would recommend this budgeting app to anyone.
3331,Mvelopes is a helpful and intuitive app!
3332,"So far is the best budgeting app I've used, after trying many."
3333,Have been with mvelopes since they started. Keep improving. Both online and now the new app update shows they have arrived. Best budgeting system available handsdown.
3334,"a literal lifesaver! Over the last 8 years I have been able to make an actual savings and wealth while paying off all of my debt thanks to this system. It takes a moment to get used to, but at 25 being debt free and about to buy a house is a win!"
3335,very helpful budgeting app. slight learning curve but VERY worth it!
3336,"Finally a budget app that works for me. Entries take just a few seconds, and I know immediately how I'm doing."
3337,after the learning curve ...üíØ
3338,very useful
3339,Very helpful
3340,"Great program, but they seem to be having a challenge with the rollout of the new website and syncing with the app. Update: looked at another response and sideloaded the app and it now seems to be working."
3341,The provided side-loaded app version worked.  Thanks.
3342,Highly convinient
3343,This app is by far the best budgeting app of its class.
3344,I love being able to look at my budget at a glance in my phone! It's very helpful.
3345,by far the best budgeting app!
3346,love this app! it helps keep our budget in line.
3347,Nice app..
3348,"Love it, helped me get into a habit of checking my finances every day with ease!"
3349,The best thing since sliced bread. Great for financial planning and achieving/living a debt free lifestyle.
3350,The notifications about new transactions to reconcile is so convenient. It helps me stay on top of my budget every day.
3351,"I have been using Mvelopes for years and appreciate the staff that is always nice, friendly, and even answers my dumbest of questions with respect and professionalism. I really enjoyed the one on one coaching as well. Made a big difference for me on my journey."
3352,This is a great app to help budget your money.
3353,Love tracking my money electronically. Makes it seem effortless.
3354,Been using this software for six years. Can't imagine life without it.
3355,love it! easy to use
3356,Perfect for minimal expenses tracking. Its simple and functional what I needed. UI is really good. No extra overload of features which are useless imo for any expense tracking. Love this app.
3357,"I think the app is great but i would just like the option of creating our own category because you can't actually predict what kind of category we would want. Please give us such an option. Other than that, it is just an incredible experience."
3358,Excellent user interface!
3359,"Guys! Work on it, I belive in you!"
3360,"Grt app, nice UI. Update is supercool. Much more options to monitor your expenses."
3361,Great work...keep it up
3362,This is a great app..i have no words to explain how great it is.  I became a fan of this app. Really mind blowing creation.. Im lucky to use this app.. Awesome ..

3378,Nice app
3379,Great work...keep it up
3380,This is app is awesome. Such an easy way to save up for a goal without noticing you are saving. Definitely recommend especially because it is customizable from rounding up to the dollar and higher amounts depending on your budget. Only downfall is it can take a while to come out of your checking out so you ha e to pay attention to the app and what funds are pending so you don't get hit hard.
3381,"Useful for personal money management, opening new free accounts for various goals, saving your money for real so that it doesn't get used for other things. Spoiler alert: it might take up to 5 days for a transfer of money from your general bank account to your Qapital card or your goal. But eventually, it works."
3382,Love this company! So easy to save without seeing the money come out in one chunk. Easy and fast to withdraw if you get in a financial bind. Enjoy having the luxury to change my savings goals whenever I please. Some months I do $1 round ups and others I do $5. Crazy how fast you end up with $500 in your account without knowing.
3383,"I used to love this app, and it's not that I don't now, but there has been a disconnect from my bank since May and my rules haven't been triggered yet. It's devastating thinking of the money I could have saved and haven't. üò≠ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3384,This app has let my wife and I save money without even thinking about saving. We can usually manage to pay for an entire vacation each year by setting a few rules to automatically set aside money. You'll save more than you'll pay for the monthly fee.
3385,"I love this app. It's amazing! I can easily save money without a reminder; it just does it for me when selecting ""Set & Forget"". It's easy to use; a total life-saver!"
3386,"When getting a tool to help you save. Qapital has exactly what's needed to be efficient, in the background and transparent! Love it"
3387,Love this app! I set rules and have saved money for trips and big.purchases without even realizing it..
3388,I've saved so much with this! I just set and forget and it saves. I wish I earned interest on my money but I just transfer to my interest bearing account when I desire.
3389,"Captial is a great way to plan, if your not a planner and gives you control over how much you will save and where the money will come from. Wheather you're saving for vacation, Christmas shopping or something else, its worth it. I love that I can round up my purchases with the change going to one of my quapital goals. Money really does build up fast. When I want to use the money I can transfer it back into my bank account. It take a few days, but its worth it."
3390,Easy Savings - those pennies add up and you quickly have a little bit stashed away to save or fun with.
3391,"I am terrible at saving money, and Qapital has helped me so much with turning that around. I have been using this app for at least 3 years and the amount of money it has helped me save for personal trips, recurring payments, and just because has been unbelieveable! The rules are editable and fun, the app's debit card has been very helpful in tight situations to do immediate transfers to fund it. This app I have recommended to my friends and family trying to save money."
3392,"Easiest way to save! As someone who was living paycheck to paycheck, I couldn't even afford to pull $10 a month out. With the easy rules in Qapital, you hardly notice the money coming out. Not to mention how easy it is to create accounts for individual goals! Investing in myself is the greatest thing I have ever done!"
3393,"While still a relatively new user I have enjoyed the service. Customer Service is excellent, design for the app is seamless in functionality and visually, and Banking service is impressive. I've already begun to save money and utilization of my IFTTT account has made customization practically endless in transfer triggers. Looking forward to growing my wealth substantially."
3394,"I love this app. My income is fairly low, and I've never been able to save much before. I always felt silly about just putting a 5 in the bank, but this app does that for me and it builds up. I have a little cushion of savings now, and I've started saving for some bigger things I thought were out of reach."
3395,"My Qapital account was stopped connecting to my bank account. Sent an email to customer support and they solved the issue immediately. I love this app. Saved a lot of money for retail therapy, vacations, gifts and just enjoyment. Even paid some bills off."
3396,I've saved over $6000 with this app. I'm a visual person so seeing money go directly into different goals really helps organize my thoughts when it comes to what money goes where. It has made me even more motivated to save as much as I can towards my goals.
3397,I can't believe it!!! that your spare change can build wealthüíØ. Joking but the app is absolutely amazing @ helping me safe big time. When your funding account is low they pause and continue when all is well. I recommend if you want to b e a discipled saver
3398,"Love this app! I can save money for family vacations, girl's day, and so more! I love that it celebrates milestones and I am putting away money without really knowing it."
3399,I love app!! It's amazing how much I can save a little at a time!!
3400,Easy way to save money for emergency or for planning a trip or for extra cash . Great app. Also helps with stocks .
3401,Love the app! I'm able to manage all my savings goals.
3402,"Great way to save money!!! For the most part, I don't even miss the withdrawals. It's 15 or 20 dollars I would've mindlessly spent elsewhere. At least this way, I can see where my money is going."
3403,I got into the app early on and its helped me save for multiple items i intended to buy. Makes it easy so you dont have to think about it it becomes automatic.
3404,Easy to use. Helped a lot with reaching my goals.
3405,I absolutely love this app I use my spare change to buy my crafts
3406,I love this app. Saving is easy when you can earmark your funds for specific purposes.
3407,You don't even notice the money coming out of your regular account. I've saved for a nice vacation with $1 round ups. Love this app. Easy to use.
3408,I've been using this app for a few years now. It makes it easy to save money. I love how I can create different goals and move my money around.
3409,"Qapital has totally changes the way I think about money. Better yet, it helps me save money when I'm not even thinking! I love this app!"
3410,Such a great way to put aside money into savings without too much hassle
3411,"Appreciate a savings app. Has a nice interface, changed review, working much more fluidly now and saving a ton of money!"
3412,Great app! We've saved a lot in a small amount of time with several different goals.
3413,Pretty clean app. I haven't had any issues with finance or the app's interface.
3414,I'm able to save so much! And the app automatically stops taking funds when my bank account is low on funds.
3415,It's a great app to use to help save money and plan trips and events for the future.
3416,This app is a life saver money you don't see or think about until you need it great emergency money I recommend everyone to use it awsome.
3417,Makes saving money very easy. Love the ability to stop if need be and resume again.
3418,I've used this app for years & have no complaints. Makes saving money do easy!
3419,I love this app. It's a great way to save money. Very easy to use and very creative ways to save your money.
3420,Love this app because its easy and settings are fantastic plus you can invest too.
3421,"Its an easy way to put money aside, i paid rent using this app. I love it."
3422,"This app makes life easy, sinking funds a easy and out of sight till you need them"
3423,Best way to save... Also they are quick to fix any issues you may have!!!
3424,Great app! Really helped me reach my savings goal.
3425,This is a fantastic tool to save for a project or just a rainy day.
3426,I have saved up so much for different goals with just the round up rule...I just watch it rack up
3427,Easiest way to save money without thinking about it! Love this app
3428,Great App!!! Helps me save towards my financial goals!
3429,Saving is quick and easy with this App.
3430,"Fantastic savings assistant disgusted as an app!!! I've paid off credit cards, saved for big purchases, trips, & start a small retirement account. Great instructions, tips & ideas. Accounts are FDIC insured & legit. I can't believe the money I've saved without even noticing. I wish I could somehow share this with the students I teach, as they are the most interested in trying it! please add the availability to mentor with a teen or youth savings account to teach teens!!!"
3431,"Qapital has helped me save better than any other saving method or app I have tried. It is simple to set up and start saving! The only caveat (which I actually think is helpful, but did want to mention here) is that it does take several business days to extract money from the qapital savings account and have it transferred to your bank. And qapital will not transfer money on weekends. Again, this helps me really think about whether I TRULY need money from my qapital savings or not."
3432,"Easy to use app, and awesome way to save."
3433,Awesome App! it helps you to save without noticing!
3434,"Having this app since it started and it works like a charm. The customized rules you can set up, the ability snoozing them (trying not to snooze them often), and just the savings one can make is amazing! Keep up the great work."
3435,Very helpful. No stress way of saving.
3436,This is the best savings app ever. You save when you spending money and you don't know how much you have saved until you check it. Just when you think your broke go check your Qapital app and Boomüí•You got moniesü§ë I love it!!!!!
3437,"Changed my financial life. My fiancee and I found it difficult to save money since we only gross about 80k collectively. In Austin, that doesn't go far. Qapital helped both of us save for a down payment on a house and now that we have our house, saving up for our wedding. I couldn't recommend it more."
3438,"Honestly love this app! I've had it for 3 years now and its so handy to have. I like how if you want to remove the money from savings it takes a few days, which keeps you from wanting to pull it out for fast cash. You can cancel your deposits as well as add more to deposit. Highly recommend this app if you want a private account seperate from your bank."
3439,"This app is phenomenal. Exactly what I needed to put some additional savings aside. So far, I been able to pay off a credit cards, set aside a reimbursement for some large expenditures made. You get to choose how passive or aggressive you want money set aside. The most useful feature is being able to see how much is scheduled to be moved from your accounts into Qapital. Definitely recommend."
3440,"I love the services that Qapital provides. I used the ""round-up and the percentage deposit rule"" to save for vacation. It is doing exactly what it say it will do. Another great feature, you can always transfer your money back to the spending account and use it immediately if you need to. When I go on vacation, I only use this card. What a joy it is to enjoy vacation without using credit cards. I recommended several friends and family members to join and they are enjoying the services as well."
3441,I love this app! It truly does allow me to save!
3442,"**UPDATE** The latest update has cause the app to force close upon open on every attempt **UPDATE** Had an issue with app force closing. Issue was corrected within an hour. **END UPDATE** Saving money is much easier when it is not an active focus. With Qapital, you just spend and it will save. Set your rules for how you want to save, be it based on transactions, deposits or both. Plus the spending account accrues monthly interest based on the account balance. This is money management made easy!"
3443,"I find it really convenient that i can deposit my payroll right into my checking account and it automatically divvies the amount according to the saving rules you set in place. I, for one, have a spending habit that Qapital helps with by making it so that I don't see the money until the money is already in the saving account(s). My only complaint is that there's no way to deposit cash. Or at least, none that I can see in the app. Maybe you can do it at an ATM at a fee."
3444,App works just as intended! It's a wonderful tool to help you save and reach personal goals. I do wish it had a Spending Habits feature where we can see where exactly we are spending our money. I will say that the investing hardly works. Last time I tried I was stuck in limbo and it never started investing.
3445,Great way to save a little extra on the side
3446,It's incredibly easy to save with this app!!
3447,I have never had problems untill today and I just transferred money 2 days ago but I just tried to get into my account and it takes me to a username and password login which is wierd it never does that I usually just enter a 4 digit to get in so I enter the information which is correct it says it does not have account connected to it and it only gives me 3 options email facebook or google. I only had it connected to my chase so help please how do I reach out I had a good amount of savings
3448,cannot access. for some reason it would not take my password. reset it twice and still will not let me access funds. Reached out to support. Lets see how long this takes I need a transfer asap lets see if they charge a fee on that as well. never an issue before
3449,I've had this app for a couple years now and I must say that it was the best thing for both me and my family. We have been able to save enough money for vacations and towards a down payment on a house. It helped curb my spending habits a lot and gets me excited to see the progress I make towards my goals.
3450,"I have a hard tim saving money because if I see it then I spend it. With this app taking the money out of my account I don't see it. I've saved so much money with this app. I don't think I'll ever stop using it, honestly. I love all the goal that you can choose from. I also love that they will stop taking money if your account it has less that 100 dollars in it. Saved me a couple of time. üò¨ If you download this app you won't regret it."
3451,I enjoy passively saving with this app. I also appreciate the automatic pause feature so as not to overextend my bank account.
3452,Easy to use. Works great!
3453,This app gelps you save so much money!! Just set the rules up and watch rhe money grow. Only downside (if anything) is that it take 2-3 business days to get the money back into the account if anything happens. Or you could just use their debit card (free!) And be able to transfer within a second
3454,"I'm TERRIBLE at saving money on my own. This App has literally helped me save money to pay off my car, pay off credit cards, and save for trips. There are a number of different ways to save through it and I take advantage of as many of them as I can. I'm currently trying to pay off my last credit card and I'm able to make almost an extra monthly payment a month thanks to Qapital!"
3455,I had to change my phone number and the staff helped me via email and a very thorough process of validating my identity before giving me access. This is a great app to use and help is available if/when needed.
3456,Great app that was a recommendation from a long time friend. It removes the stress from saving but makes it encouraging. I wish I had knowledge of this app years ago.
3457,Mindless savings and investment with spare change (roundup rules) is truly painless! $.30 adds up fast! Investing for beginners is also cool using this app. I have a small goal account w/ lower risk / moderate returns.
3458,I absolutely love this app. Having my money in a separate account allows my money to be out of sight and out of mind enabling me to save for emergencies.
3459,This app has helped me save for my car and my down payment for my house. I've saved thousands without even realizing it. I 100% suggest it for anyone who wants to save money without having to actively save yourself.
3460,Love Qapital. It really helps accomplish short term goals
3461,I Love this app...it has definitely helped me save!
3462,It's Sooo easy to save. I set the goal of how much I want and Qapital does the rest. It keeps a running tab on the front page. No brainer for ANYONE wanting an extra savings plan.
3463,Got locked out of my account and couldn't withdraw money AT ALL!! The customer support team told me what I needed and I got my account back the same day. Long story short be careful when closing your bank accounts ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
3464,This has helped us save so much! We are close to our goal for a down-payment on our first home without even thinking about it. I highly recommend trying this out!
3465,I love having this account as a back up. It automatically deposits in there. I see the money coming out of my other account but its never big enough amounts that it effects my day to day spending.
3466,great app! i like to use it for goals or as a way to keep track of money I'm borrowing from myselfor to save up for a particular goal.
3467,It's a really dope savings app if you need help getting organized. I was hating at first so I deleted it but came back this year and I am not disappointed.
3468,"I've used Qapital for over a year now. It is the best way to automatically save and monitor your spending! I've honestly saved so much with Qapital, and managed to start investing without any extra thought. Thanks guys!!"
3469,"This is a great app that is simple to use and an easy way to save money for special projects, trips, etc!"
3470,Best way to save money without even noticing it!
3471,Excellent app that has helped me save without thinking about it. It seems i can't change my funding account to another linked account. If i can't i will have to stop using the app which i really like.
3472,I love this app. Simple easy way to save money and not feel the hard take ways.
3473,Great way to manage savings goals!!
3474,Great app that continues to make life easy
3475,"Overall, easy to use and the only thing that has helped me consistently save money!!"
3476,Basic membership has helped me save a lot. Only complaint is that it'll unlink my bank account about once a month
3477,"Fluid, personal, secure, and easy to use. Really makes saving easy."
3478,it's help me pay bills. I've had these app for awhile now and I find it's really useful for saving in things I want and need.
3479,Super cool! Love this app. I have a hard time saving money but this app helps me out to do that.
3480,Saving is so easy!
3481,Such a great way to put aside money into savings without too much hassle
3482,Easy to use. Works great!
3483,You don't even notice the money coming out of your regular account. I've saved for a nice vacation with $1 round ups. Love this app. Easy to use.
3484,Awesome way to organize your goals
3485,Easy Savings - those pennies add up and you quickly have a little bit stashed away to save or fun with.
3486,Something like this combined with Robinhood would be nice.
3487,"Using Qapital allowed me to actually save up enough for a down payment for my house! Because money is deposited on its own I'm able to completely ignore it and since it's only a dollar here and there, it's not a significant amount at once to really affect my budget. I love how easy it is to transfer the money as well as create, edit and pause goals. Qapital will be a staple in my finances for years to come"

3490,"I used to love this app, and it's not that I don't now, but there has been a disconnect from my bank since May and my rules haven't been triggered yet. It's devastating thinking of the money I could have saved and haven't. üò≠ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3491,Easy to use. Helped a lot with reaching my goals.
3492,Love this app! I set rules and have saved money for trips and big.purchases without even realizing it..
3493,I absolutely love this app I use my spare change to buy my crafts
3494,I love this app. It helps me save and I don't even feel it. It has come in handy with emergency car expenses so many times. I highly recommend this app.
3495,"Super easy! I finally have a rainy day fund, and started goals for travel, ""fun money"" and a down payment on a house. I like that I can save much more aggressively on some goals and super slowly chip away at others."
3496,Easy way to save money for emergency or for planning a trip or for extra cash . Great app. Also helps with stocks .
3497,Love this company! So easy to save without seeing the money come out in one chunk. Easy and fast to withdraw if you get in a financial bind. Enjoy having the luxury to change my savings goals whenever I please. Some months I do $1 round ups and others I do $5. Crazy how fast you end up with $500 in your account without knowing.
3498,"I love this app. It's amazing! I can easily save money without a reminder; it just does it for me when selecting ""Set & Forget"". It's easy to use; a total life-saver!"
3499,This is app is awesome. Such an easy way to save up for a goal without noticing you are saving. Definitely recommend especially because it is customizable from rounding up to the dollar and higher amounts depending on your budget. Only downfall is it can take a while to come out of your checking out so you ha e to pay attention to the app and what funds are pending so you don't get hit hard.
3500,Since having the app i have been able to really save.
3501,Great saving app. 100%recommend
3502,Exceptional app
3503,I love app!! It's amazing how much I can save a little at a time!!
3504,"Useful for personal money management, opening new free accounts for various goals, saving your money for real so that it doesn't get used for other things. Spoiler alert: it might take up to 5 days for a transfer of money from your general bank account to your Qapital card or your goal. But eventually, it works."
3505,Love the app! I'm able to manage all my savings goals.
3506,I've saved so much with this! I just set and forget and it saves. I wish I earned interest on my money but I just transfer to my interest bearing account when I desire.
3507,This app has let my wife and I save money without even thinking about saving. We can usually manage to pay for an entire vacation each year by setting a few rules to automatically set aside money. You'll save more than you'll pay for the monthly fee.
3508,Try it!!!

I have been using this app for at least 3 years and the amount of money it has helped me save for personal trips, recurring payments, and just because has been unbelieveable! The rules are editable and fun, the app's debit card has been very helpful in tight situations to do immediate transfers to fund it. This app I have recommended to my friends and family trying to save money."

3536,"I love this app. My income is fairly low, and I've never been able to save much before. I always felt silly about just putting a 5 in the bank, but this app does that for me and it builds up. I have a little cushion of savings now, and I've started saving for some bigger things I thought were out of reach."
3537,I have saved up so much for different goals with just the round up rule...I just watch it rack up

3548,"This is hands down the easiest way to save (and invest) money that I have ever come across in my life. I have never been great at saving and know nothing about investing, but this app does all the heavy lifting. I just took a little bit of time to set the round up rules, goals, etc...the app has been doing the rest ever since. If you struggle to save or just want to streamline the process, this app is great for that. Spare change adds up quick."
3549,Greattt App!!!
3550,I love using this app to save
